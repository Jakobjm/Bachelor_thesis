stephen hawking gives the definitive answer to the eternal question ,0,kpbd6v
just found this while reading so when he broke the rules it was okay because he knew he was right because he was the son of god thats correct he said when he turned out the merchants and moneychangers from the temple when he refused to dance to herods tune when he told people not to evade taxes he knew he was doing what was right he was surprised yet pleased that he seemed to be getting through to her i think i see what youre saying she said slowly if the son of god breaks the rules thats perfectly fine and righteous because hes the son of god yes exactly he crowed it was working it was working and if the son of god defies a ruling order he thinks is corrupt thats fine because hes the son of god exactly exactly he said like his preacher at the pulpit and if the son of god suffers greatly because of his conviction that only makes him even holier she said yes he said he wasnt exactly sure if that was true but he was getting through to her she smiled widely so lucifer was right to rebel from harry potter grandson of god linkworkskin,0,koz0my
story of a atheist king in hinduism atheist king hiranya kashyapu hated god however his own son was a devotee of god he hated devotees of the lord so much that the king tried to kill his son simply because his son was religious and not an atheist like him but alas before he could do that lord vishnu himself appeared and stopped him and defeated him for good and this is the story of how lord vishnu stopped an immoral atheist from committing immoral acts learn from this story hare krishna,0,kpiorp
do all of us atheists look at these posts in absolute disbelief ive seen this sub pop up now and then ive never gave any top post a second glance i am absolutely shocked at how controversial being an atheist seems to be ive never met a truly religious person and seeing some folk here defend the way they chose to live their entire lives sometimes based on some absolute fucking nonsense someone else told them what kind of life is that how long will it truly take to rid this world of religion whether you consider your religion goodbadevilsatanic i honestly an atheist do not give a fuck why are you making life decisions based on shit youve been told to believelovetrust booksscrollswhatever its absolute fucking madness and it needs to stop wake up and realise its all just stories of people a long time ago who did not have a clue whatsoever,0,kp8qmy
my parents gift i only understand this as i get older but the gift my parents gave me is the single most important gift a parent could give my father is agnostic while my mother is highly spiritual despite that they still gave me the gift of choice they never tried to indoctrinate me instead trying to broaden my horizons so i could come to a more informed and complete decision on my own naturally i became an atheist and they were fine with that as long as i came to this decision on my own they encouraged me to challenge beliefs i disagreed with so i would not blindly follow a path without reason and logic i strive to provide the same opportunity to my own children and for others to do the same teaching people to think for themselves is the most empowering gift of all something religion has tried to take away for as long as it existed the lack of choice and almost industrial indoctrination of young minds into religion is one of the major reasons my country usa has one of the lowest education rates among first world countries the poison of religion has seeped into politics education and so many other aspects of american life,0,koz8ou

hasanabi religion is not the problem conservatism within religion is hasanabi video original video progressive christians vs conservative christians by jubilee and hasanabi comments on progressive christians vs conservative christians and shows interesting flaws in the structure of arguments from some of the participating christians participants in the video debate about the following positions and whywhy not they believe in them what to you is a good christian the republican party embodies christian values more than the democratic party lgbtq couples should be allowed to get married in the church jesus would protest for the blm movement the other side misrepresents christianity meaning progressive vs conservative hasanabis position on conservative christians starts around religion is supposed to offer you a moral code that code has a set of basic principles and those revolve around being kind to another doing whats right etc and that goes completely against conservatism both in its theory and also in its application individual liberty is not more important than the collective good humans are selfinterested humans care about selfpreservation so all matter of moral codes and guidances go against that the entire purpose of human existence and societal development revolves around fighting that selfish nature that we have with selflessness the code of conduct that pushes us towards a societal development and coexisting with one another is going against the selfish act that we engage in so of course religion is going to be anticonservative you cant have religious conservatives because there are a lot of conservative hyperindividualistic points of view without factoring in the benefits of mutual aid,0,kqyoad

am i an atheist in my opinion religion is just another human constuct sure god could be real and i do hope that a higher power exists but i just dont have blind faith that it does exist i need scientific facts or some sort of empirical evidence then again how would i prove with science the love that i have for my son most of my family is religious and i was raised to be a christian however i just dont really believe one way or the other that god does or does not exist i respect all religions and have no issue with the people who want to follow a religion but religion just doesnt make sense to me its my opinion that some humans just need to believe in things like religion iits like the concept of religion provides some kind of coping mechanism for a persons existentialism overall i think religion is hurting more than it is helping,0,kp55tk
contradiction believing in god so i often think about how is it possible that god leaves to us mere humans who are limited in knowledge and wisdom the taskduty to believe in him so that we are able to get into heaven i mean if god created us whit these faults and expects us to believe in him blindly wouldnt that be a contradiction its like if i created a robot and give it only so much knowledge and then expect it to believe in me when it just simply does not have the ability to do so why god does not simply show himself to us maybe we are not worthy of seeing him or to even acknowledge his existence yet we are supposed to,0,kp5706
baptising or worse even circumcising your child at birth is the rights violation no one is talking about by doing the aforementioned we narrow their scope of moral development restricting them into believing that the religion of their familygovt is right but a lot of the time children could have chosen a different religion if baptising at birth wasnt a thing but they confuse it being the only option they are subconsciously given between it being something they choose even if there is a god who will in their afterlife punish them for not following their religion which is highly unlikely from our beliefs it would be better for them to choose a religion when they become selfconscious and have developed their own though patterns rather then being indoctrinated at birth the same applies to almost any values we try to pass on first let him learn to walk talk read and think then let him choose his values,0,krlenk

i cant leave church because it might diminish my career options and it makes me furious i was born and raised in a rather catholic part of germany so i was baptized my mom was more of a new ager with reincarnation karma and meditation so i never felt like a part of the church while studying psychology i replaced faith with science and am content with that now i look for jobs and guess what churches in germany have a lot of leverage many clinics are lead by either the catholic or evangelic church and in their job description being part of christianity sharing christian values and leading a christian lifestyle are a regular read i wanted to leave church not only because i dont believe in it but also because you need to pay church tax but as i see it i could not work in any of those many many organizations which are good places to work dont get me wrong apparently somehow the churches weaseled themselves through antidiscrimination laws which prevent this in any other company and i am so disappointed in my country that this is legal,0,kpiqet
it does not make sense kind of a shower thought but if god really did exist why could god not descend down to earth and prove there existence to reinstate all of religion in the world or at send out this jesus guy to prove at least he existalso if god really did why is there such horrible untreatable diseases and war if gos really did exist it could at least stop all of the bad stuff what i really dont understand is these desperate people constantly praying to no avail when theres never actually been any evidence of a miracle or the fact that you shouldnt pray to someone who does not actually give half a fuck about anyone by just letting major negative events happen why couldnt god stop hitler was it because those people the jewish people did not directly believe in the catholicchristianmormon god etc that would be stating that god does not care about humans that dont care for him perhaps lets say the jewish people do believe in the same exact god but celebrate gods existence differently i dont know all the details i know this may sound a bit wonky but im feeling doozy after taking my melatonin lets just say in the why care about a god who does not care about you,0,kpiksx

heres a copypasta of arguments to use against a christian if you dont have time to write it down ill put it in the comments so you can copy it why would there be god why do we have imperfections if someone as strong as god can just snap his fingers see them and fix them why do all the religions before are invalid but what you believe in now is valid why do you trust a random ancient book talking about some prophet why did only jesus followers see him after his resurrection is there any evidence to the wonders that jesus did why would god make us if he could make the world just a sandbox for whatever he wants to do how can you explain microbes on mars dont say they are lying how can you explain dinosaurs dont say they are fake thats a really random thing to fake why would god randomly create a tree restrict adam and eve from eating its fruits and then kick them out of heaven for eating it makes no sense if this all doesnt make sense then how are you sure that saints did wonders too why dont you acknowledge tge fact that religion is just a way to manipulate people to be better and made up by some guy who just wants to believe that he wont cease from existence after death dont you think that all those changes to christianity probably wouldnt be approved by god but nothing happens take a wild guess why you need to realise that people before were credulous and its rooted in your mind because they thought their children so you need to think about it yourself and come to a wiser decision im out,0,kpfe0w

god disproved eternal energy created everything else what happens after you die god disproved eternal energy created everything else what happens after you die by tom fearnley god is defined as an immaterial intelligence immaterial means not made of energymatter i argue later that everything is made of energy or nowithoutsans energymatter or not material which just means no energymatter what does no energymatter mean its something we have no understanding of at all so god becomes a something we dont have any understanding of at all intelligence this is a logical contradiction an impossibility like saying an unmarried married man in other words what im saying here is that god is a immaterial something we have no understanding of at allsomething we do have an understanding of intelligence see the contradiction something we dont have an understanding of something we do have an understanding of this is the basic argument and now ill go into more detail showing why the agnostic and theist counterresponses to this argument are false the agnostic response agnostics can try to respond by saying if immaterial means something we have no understanding of at all then we cant say its not intelligent and we cant say its not nonintelligent we have to say we dont know whether its intelligent or not but this is false because we have at least some understanding of intelligence and we have at least some understanding of nonintelligence so something we have no understanding of at all cant be intelligent and it cant be nonintelligent because we have an understanding of both in other words something we have no understanding of at all can be defined in one word nothing what does nothing mean nothing is notnonintelligent and not intelligent at the same time its neither intelligent nor is it non intelligent so the agnostic is saying immaterial might be intelligent or not i dont know when immaterialnothing is defined as something which is neither intelligent or nonintelligent so therefore it cant be either the agnostic position is a contradiction also its like saying its not intelligent or nonintelligent but it might be intelligent or nonintelligent the theist response theists have responded to me by saying that immaterial means no energymatter then when i respond by saying if immaterial is not energymatter and not nothing then what is it they will respond by repeating as a mantra that it means no energymatter they will never give a definition because clearly they dont understand what it means its something they have no understanding of at all theists say what immaterial is not not energymatter not nothing not saying what it is this is like saying a cat is not a tree not a bicycle not a pen not a dog without ever getting to what it is a cat theyre saying what immaterial is not and not what it is what it does mean thus avoiding giving a definition first say what immaterial is then give an explanation of what you understand about it then give examples of immaterial theists will just jump straight to the examples stage by saying eg spacetime is immaterial or consciousness is immaterial without even saying what immaterial is and then what they know about it another response i have got is that immaterial is information first of all this is just attempting to redefine the word and secondly from the little i understand about the word information i do understand that the dictionary definition ends in the word thing a thing is something material made of energymatter thus immaterial cannot be information but this is not how the word is defined generally anyway that you put immaterialsomething we have no understand of at allnothingsomething meaningless god becoming a meaningless meaningful intelligence in that case we can see a logical contradiction is created and we can know with certainty that no godgodsimmaterial intelligence exist god is therefore disproved nothing disproved nothing means not nonintelligent and not intelligent at the same time but a notnon intelligence the notnon is a double negative so a notnon intelligence becomes an intelligence nothing now reads as intelligent and not intelligent at the same time but you cant be intelligent and not intelligent at the same time you are either intelligent or not one or the other so nothing is just another logical contradiction like saying an unmarried married man this rules out nothing as a possibility with certainty for what created everything else there is really no such thing as something we know nothing about at all because we have an understanding that all things now nothing is disproved must logically be either intelligent or nonintelligent we know at least something about them about all things this is the case even though there are no doubt things we havent discovered observed scientifically yet something we know nothing about at all is a logical impossibility and becomes impossible or nonexistent god is thus an immaterial impossiblenonexistent intelligence god is the ultimate married bachelor eternal energy created everything else except itself we have ruled out god as a possibility for what created everything else with certainty we have ruled out nothing with certainty agnosticism is certainly wrong and matter was created this leaves only one possibility eternal energy created everything else energy cant be created or destroyed energy according to victor j stenger in his book god the failed hypothesis william lane craig in his debate with stenger and imperial college creates minute amounts of matter particles so energy creates matter what is inside an atom strings of energy what is the casing of an atom made of to the best of my knowledge particles where do particles come from energy we can know therefore that an eternal source of energy we scientifically yet know little to nothing about other than logical telling us it must be energy with certainty created everything else by itself what happens after you die i dont know but we have ruled out god as a possibility so there is certainly no heaven or hell that a god or gods created there are four main possibilities that happen after you die as the brain is where human reality comes from the mind is part of reality therefore the mind is in the brain when the brain dies then so do we going into nothingnonexistence we wont have memoriesbrains etc so how do we live on if the mind is indestructible energy encased in an atom or molecule then we could get reincarnated billions of years from now as single cells on to other planets the single cells dont have brains or central nervous systems so cant feel pain we would keep coming back as single cells for eternity even whenif the new universe is formed after heat death if nasa gets the technology instead of becoming single cells and being reincarnated we get resurrected not reincarnated as very advanced cyborgs which feel no pain for eternity we would die the suddenly then wake instantly as these cyborgs having no memory on the transition between death and our next life evil rogue ai resurrects us and tortures us for control of us for eternity i very much doubt this would happen as i have not blind faith but evidence based faith based on history of past human survival experiences that we will make sure that ai doesnt turn out to be evil remember after you

the church spends a lot of money to fund hospitals right i recently came across an article about church operated hospitals in germany since those hospitals can eg refuse to employ doctors and nurses who do not share the religion of the respective church i have always assumed that considerable amounts of church taxes are spent to maintain those hospitals boy was i wrong the article is from but as far as i know the legal circumstances have not changed since then i translated some parts of the article and apologise for any grammatical mistakes source heike jackler finanzierung der krankenhuser in kirchlicher trgerschaft der humanist viewed january lt financing of church operated hospitals time and time again the churches and christian politicians accuse nondenominationals of using the churches social infrastrucutre without financially contributing to it hospitals are often cited as an example a fitting example because almost every citizen will require their services at some point the church gives the impression that a considerable amount of the hospitals finances come from church taxes however the answers to my request to the competent authorities show that this is not the case in order to get honest answers i did not ask the regional churches dioceses and bishoprics about the social utilisation of church taxes but instead complained i just cannot fathom why the church with its financial problems has to pay for ecclesiastical hospitals while nonecclesiastical hospitals can offset all costs with the payments of health insurance companies what percentage of church taxes does dioceseregional church xy spend for its hospitals of course i only mean payments that are not refinanced through profits the replies of the churches some reacted quickly others had to be reminded persistently were revealing replies evangelical catholic did not even once claim that church taxes are acutally being used to maintain ecclesiastical churches examples your assumption that church taxes are used to fund this hospital is incorrect regional church of anhalt the diocese of augsburg does not spend any funds from church taxes on the construction and maintenance of hospitals it would indeed be most problematic if the church funded the ongoing operation of ecclesiastical hospitals and therefore subsidised departments that are in competition with other facilities that does not happen evangelical church of baden does not spend church taxes on ecclesiastical hospitals archdiocese of berlin the maintenance of hospitals is to be financed with the negotiated hospitalisation rates bishopric of dresdenmeien the answer is short the bishopric of erfurt spends of church tax revenues on hospitals the hospitals finance themselves and without grants from the bishopric in the bishopric of essen there is a principle that no church taxes are used for ecclesiastical hospitals however on its homepage the bishopric writes by using church taxes they fulfill tasks that would otherwise be done by the state maintaining nurseries and schools hospitals and retirenment homes at present the catholic hospitals are not financed with church taxes archbishopric of hamburg they finance their operating and investment costs like all other hospitals the regional church does not provide funds for these departments regional church of hannover no funds from chruch taxes whatsoever regional church of hessennassau cannot confirm that ecclesiastical hospitals are funded with church taxes bishopric of hildesheim can soothe you with the information that no funds from church taxes are being used whatsoever bishopric of mainz according to the church president church taxes are usually not used to fund hospitals evangelical church of pfalz ecclesiastical hospitals receive no funds from church taxes neither regular payments nor onetime payments evangelical regional church of wrttemberg norbert gro the director of the union of german evangelical hospitals provided detailed information these funds which are transferred to individual parishes by the regional churches are intended for traditional church work and certain diaconal tasks eg nurseries diaconal care services maintaining hospitals is not part of that only spiritual welfare is named as a churchfunded cost factor some hospitals employ pastors literal translation someone who cares for the soul who are funded using church taxes however this is a totally different matter than the problem of funding hospitals the caritas umbrella organisation of catholic welfare organisations provided similar information although the german bishops conference has no documents whatsoever regarding the funding of hospitals it does provide information on its homepage propaganda about of an average diocesan budget are spent for social services like advice centers nurseries hospitals und retirenment homes there are also churches whose statements regarding taxes depend on how this information is going to be used the church of bremen evangelical forwarded my inquiry to our lawyer also it would be good to know why you are interested in the funding of evangelical hospitals are you in a role that requires this knowledge the conclusion of my research although the church spends almost no money on the construction and no money at all on the maintenance of hospitals it threatens to withdraw from hospital services if the church tax is abolished the german government collects taxes for the church or if their tax revenues are endangered because people leave the church the ones who suffer from the churches monopoly position are the employees of ecclesiastical hospitals although the church does not pay their salaries they have to give up their constitutional right of religious freedom when they submit their applications not believing in god as well as herecy can be a reason to terminate the employment they are also excluded from other rights they are allowed to organise themselves but their labour unions have to recognise the principles of the church as well as the employees duty of loyalty strikes are forbidden the german constitution allows churches to resolve their own matters

im thinking about starting a club at my school for atheismadvocacy for the separation of church and state any suggestions on some topics to discuss outside of the separation of church and state also any ideas for a name like i said in the title im planning on making it mostly based on general atheism with topics about the separation of church and state and organizing peaceful protests in our state as more of a sidetopicoccasional topic in order to start it i want to make sure i have more topics than just the one should i just make it a club about governmental secularism advocacy rather than an atheistic base,0,krt2z1
islam is getting away with too much and there are people protecting it just what it says on the box people act as if christianity was the only religion legible for criticism its not like radical islamists are an exception they seem to be the rule when you talk with ex muslims most of them have a lot to say and so many of them are ignored or called islamophobic im sorry but islam demands people are stoned to death that demands thieves to have their hands cut off that normalises and supports slavery marital rape and violence and demands death of all non believers yes christianity does that to but can we stop letting islam get a pass without as much as a question just because of being progressive progress is good but maybe right here we are progressing in the wrong way,0,kojwr1
part of my family believes im satanist a bit of the background since i realised im an atheist and later antitheist ive been pretty open with my disagreement and criticism of religion at about the same time i have picked up a hobby of collecting ornate decorative knives including replicas of sacrificial daggers simply because of my interest in historical weapons daggersknives are much cheaper than swords my family decided to connect the dots however poorly and apparently arrived to the conclusion that i am an aspiring satanist is there a way to clear that misunderstanding up,0,kq8tr8
on metaphorical interpretations of religious scripture specifically the bible i have never believed in any religion but i have always found religion pretty fascinating as a phenomenon and i have wondered about the possibility that a lot of religious scripture might have been written as metaphors to teach life lessons what do you guys think i will list some stuff from the bible below and how i think it would make sense metaphorically gods omnipotense and omnipresence the god of the bible is described as being omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent would this not make god simply the fabric of reality heaven and hell it is said that sin will make you go to hell and living without sin will grant you a place in heaven if you think of hell as a mental state of suffering it is analogous to stating that hurting other people and doing bad things will cause one to suffer and doing good makes one feel good the fruit of knowledge and the original sin by eating fruit from the tree of knowledge man commited the original sin and was cast out of from gods kingdom i interpret this as meaning consciousness is what enables a person to suffer in the first place and being born into sin and having to look for salvation is accepting and coming to terms with this reality do you think a lot of religious scripture was written with the intentions of teaching lessons similar to these and if so why the need for all of the mystiscism curious to hear your thoughts about this kind of stuff,0,kpijot

opinions on the subreddit the state of this subreddit is truly awful ratheism should be a place to discuss atheism instead its more of an antireligion subreddit most of the posts here are criticising religous leaders or followers for being shitty people in general theres bad eggs everywhere this is something that people need to understand whether youre religous or not that doesnt matter just because you dont have a faith doesnt make you any better a person similarly going to church every week doesnt make you a good person either ive seen comments and posts saying how atheists are supposedly better people than most christians theres an odd superiority complex for choosing not to believe in a higher power its not right to assume that a collective group of people are worst than the average human being just because of a minority causing mayhem not wearing masks embezzlement etc we need to understand that theres shitty people everywhere i think this subreddit genuinely has a lot of potential and it really has a lot more to offer than just attacking religions or religious people for being bad people i know my opinion probably doesnt matter but i hope that this subreddit will be centered around the discussion of atheism in the future it would be really interesting to see,0,kq95dd

the superstitions of god while the discussions about the absence of god and his limitations are interesting the premises used today seem selfdefeating in that we discuss what god he can do or wont do under the religious premises of god being real and needing to be disproved along with the paradoxes of his presumed existence in the discussions itself so to me at at least instead of asking why cant god prove his of existence by doing miracles now how can god come from nothing why does god permit genocide of various groups etc the intentional framing of these questions itself seems to presume there is a god that can prove its own existence as told in stories but choses not to do therefor giving an opening for that defense of god while also implying that miracles can happen to begin with that seems self defeating by itself therefor i prefer to discuss religion on entirely different terms coming from a materialistic and naturalistic view to reframe these discussions itself taking my first question as an example given that miracles do not happen today nor are they normal by any means how can an unnatural being be real lets assume miracles are real and therefor magic is real by being a common and natural events in society that consistently happen along with growing plants and strong winds of nature with the supernatural being natural it would then be a science that could be observed and studied to create legitimate scientific theories about these events like for example how one could create their own wives out of their own rib bones that would therefor be possible to do as it would have happen had magic itself not been unnatural and a non existing material as a consequence then by being part of the existing world then the entire concept of the supernatural have no basis to exist as it wouldnt be unnatural for these things to happen there wouldnt be a question of faith in otherworldly creatures that can only be described as lovecraftian because the creatures wouldnt be unnatural at all,0,krm38n
how do i stop thinking with christian logic ive been an atheist for a while now and despite having the atheist logic to know that there is no good reason for me to believe in any god i still think like a christian i realised just now when watching a tv show there was a villain who halfsuccessfully tried to kill every resident of a certain area this was thousands of people he did it because there were a lot of criminally bad people there he believed that the only way to fix the place was to kill everyone and destroy everything in order to rebuild the place while i knew that he was the villain of the story because he had to fight the main characters heroes i didnt hate him the way i should have i sometimes liked him more than the heroes of the show i looked up to him this season there was a new villain villain was the same as villain but on a larger scale he wanted to destroy the world he had a place built that could withstand the damage of the weapons he was using within that place he held his allies his family and his army the plan was called genesis because it was just like noahs ark it was then that i realized that both villains were just like god and the only reason that i didnt like villain is because i never saw a good side of him also hes more awesome especially in fight scenes that leads us to the title how do i escape thinking like a christian how do i stop thinking in a certain way when i dont even know that i am thinking in that way how do i truly free my mind from years of indoctrination,0,kqheal

im an atheist but i really dont get this subreddit i dont believe in any religion or a higher power what i dont understand is how people can not believe in something and then also be aggressively against it if its not real then why is it bad ive seen numerous posts here saying that participation in religious activities is extremely against what they believe in i can understand if people want to choose to not participate in something they dont want to what i dont understand is when people will completely cut people off partners friends who are religious because of their beliefs or refuse to marry someone if its a religious ceremony if you dont believe in whats going on there and the religious activities mean nothing then why is it meaningful when you participate it almost implies that you do believe and want to oppose in conclusion this subreddit really reflects how bigoted some people can be by not accepting that other people are entitled to believe in whatever they want as long as it hasnt been scientifically disproved eg antivaxers are fucking idiots at the moment we cant scientifically prove religion but we also cant scientifically disprove it either this doesnt go out to everyone in this sub ive seen plenty of posts not saying that religious people are inferior,0,konuru

 things you didnt know about god when brutal murder or genocide takes place instead of helping the victims god just enjoys the show cuz god respects bad peoples freewill than those victims lives when god created hell he knew for a fact that some people will burn in hell one day otherwise he wouldnt have created it so that means there are some people who will definitely go to hell no matter how hard they try to avoid it so where is freewill youre the product of your environment your environment hugely dictates your behavior and impacts your long term habits so if youre born in a bad environment and do bad deeds then its all your fault cuz god gave you freewill the fact that you were born in a wrong environment doesnt count thats what god said dont blame me lets be honest god has created beautiful people and god has also created ugly people if god has created them both then god either is cruel af or dumb as hell i once asked a religious person the description of heaven she drew a shiny picture of heaven in my mind with lots of mansions delicious foods gardens etc then i asked her if true happiness comes from within then why do i need all those fancy items in heaven,0,kpbpuc

why do you choose to be an atheist have you ever seen one of those boys vs girls memes where the boys are doing some warrior like things and the girls are doing some romantic things this type of memes makes me cringe because of the huge generalization there are millions of guys who are socially awkward and never leaves their house and then there are a ton of girls who are boxers and mma fighters the point im trying to make here is people generalize just too much when it comes to theists or atheists for example not all theists are the same some of them worship god purely due to social conditioning some of theme believe in god due to their self satisfactory reasoning then there are theists who believe they are all gods and so on similarly i believe atheists have different reasons to believe in what they believe some of them called god when they were helpless and found no one so that naturally made them atheists to life some of them are hardcore philosophers who can easily see fault in different religious scriptures some of them just see too much injustice and corruption in this world for a god to exist so they dont have a single reason to believe in god so what is your reason for not believing in god im asking this because this reason alone may help you dig deeper into your true nature,0,kqk6jm
i do not believe in god but saying so brings me so much uncontrollable guilt bc of my extremely catholic upbringing any advice hi im looking for advice or maybe some comforting words im someone who has struggled with extreme emotional issues from early on with childhood trauma and all that and one of my biggest issues is unjustified guilt where i take everything i do or say it even think and brand myself as a terrible person with no reason to be alive i feel so much shame and guilt everyday and i am exhausted ive been talking with my therapist and weve come to the conclusion that my strict catholic upbringing has left me with major self esteem issues as well as crippling guilt i grew up in a family where i was constantly afraid of going to hell for thinking bad thoughts and constantly apologized for hurting peoples feelings for having my own emotions as well as refusing to forgive those who traumatized me as a child because i was petrified god would punish me and that i wouldnt be deserving of life i come to you because religion has hurt me in so many ways and i find myself feeling so much relief when i turn to the idea of no god in general and no one judging my intrusive and uncontrollable thoughts and if there was a god i simply do not understand why he would let me be traumatized so many times over even though i put faith in him it doesnt make sense that being said i cant help grappling with horrible guilt over this lingering idea that im going to hell or that im a terrible person for rejecting and not believing in a god i believe in atheism but i cannot accept myself for doing so im struggling now to accept the fact that my religious upbringing has hurt me and that i need to change for my health and wellbeing but i need support i cannot ask my family about this because theyre all extremely religious im sorry for the long post does anyone have any advice or words of wisdom even just some compassion im really lost right now thank you very much for reading,0,kprko6

never had religion still moral because human my parents are agnostic at best so i was never raised with religion even my grandparents verged on atheism but i was raised to be moral and good for the benefit of my community and my planet not because i would get a reward when i die thats not being moral thats doing a thing for profit and when i see someone in trouble i help them when i get too much change back i return it when i have some trash i toss it in the garbage or recycling bin in matters large and small i try to do the right thing i dont need a magic sky daddy to tell me whats right and wrong i know i do it because we are all in this together one planet one life one chance to not be a dick morality comes from good example and good parenting not necessarily religion i was fortunate to have adults in my life who taught me im also not an antisocial narcissist so that helps too and basically all im saying is i want to do right atheism doesnt get in the way of that it makes it easier,0,kpksiq

i dont think atheism is right nor is religion ill try to explain why i think that sometimes you do need to believe in something irrationally i dont expect everyone to agree and ill gladly discuss this with anyone the following paragraphs are aimed at explaining how i got to these thoughts if you want to skip straight to my conclusion its in the tldr at the bottom i was raised catholic at first being the clueless child i was i believed in god and everything just like the average christian my family was not insanely catholic eventually somewhere between and grade i became an atheist i dont know what exactly changed my mind but back then i fully believed that i had outgrown religion and was a better thinker than most other people in my environment after all i was almost the only one to realize how much nonsense all this talking about god is i thought there cant be an omniscient allpowerful being it doesnt make sense theres no reason for it to exist so every religion must be wrong thats how i thought but although i did tell people i was atheist when they asked me and i certainly did not believe in any kind of god i still acted as if i did i went to church when my parents asked us to i took part in a few programs for catholic children i dont know what stopped me from going full atheist but today i feel like i solved this riddle this feeling that kept me acting like a christian was what ill call intuition in this post ill explain the meaning this word has to me in the tldr eventually around my birthday there was a project to prepare people of my age for their confirmation i took part in it and during a day camp i at some point felt like i know there could be something like a god there is no reason for him to exist but there is no reason for him not to either for a while after that i was confused some days i was the convinced atheist who could tell others in full confidence that god does not exist never has and never will and on other days i was willing to accept that there can be or in fact there is a god from that day i called myself an agnostic but i knew that something wasnt quite right i did not say that i neither do believe in god nor do i not believe he exists i was always fully convinced of one side but which side that changed every now and then i can tell you from my own experience that the purely atheistic phases were the worst i was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and many times i thought about just doing it there was no logical reason against it and yet i didnt do it why i didnt understand that for a long time but now i do recently a few months ago i was rummaging the bookshelves in the house and came across a specific book if youre interested i dont know if the german version is the original it was the buch ohne titel written by raymond m smullyan and this book made me think about many things one of them being this dilemma and eventually i came to this conclusion which is also the tldr which is especially open for discussion conclusion i think that the conscience of a human can be segmented into two parts reason and intuition reason is the logical part of conscience any logical conclusions are done by reason reason is what atheism and science are built on it follows simple universal rules such as if a contradicts b and is true then b is false or other similar ones intuition is the spiritual part of conscience this includes mostly emotions and is the fundamental aspect of any kind of religion it is individually different for everyone and follows only the rules of the individuum itself please note the intuition is what i see as the deity of the individuum this is why i think that atheism is against intuition i might be wrong here i believe that reason is the tool to be used in interactions with other people the universality of logical arguments etc makes it easy to agree on something because within reason everything is either objectively wrong or objectively right intuition on the other hand is made for only the individuum itself it does not require any special effort and is present at all times and leads to decisions almost immediately this is so i believe what makes the person unique as intuition does not follow any rules besides those of the person itself to summarize intuition is what leads to your own happiness and reason helps dealing with conflicts between you and other people conclusion many people including atheists claim that reason is correct while intuition is false but i dont think this is a valid argument if people say intuition is wrong because it doesnt make sense is that not the same as to say intuition is wrong because it doesnt follow the rules of reason and wouldnt this be like letting the prosecuter reason judge the defendant intuition that cant be right on the other hand ive heard many people including religious people say that reason is wrong because it goes against our heartsinner selfwhatever which can be rephrased as reason is wrong because it doesnt follow the rules of intuition same case but reversed we cannot determine whether reason or intuition is right therefore we cannot be sure whether atheism or religion is better so we have to accept that both can be the correct choice to follow and if one is better in one case it might be worse in another when to choose which is always your own choice but my own personal experience is intuition makes me happy and reason makes it easier to interact with others to get back to the title of this post neither atheism nor religion is definitely correct it always depends on the situation either one of them is better in a case or both are equally good for different goals if atheism is correct then religion can also be correct and vice versa so ive realized that this tldr is a bit longer than i planned ive tried putting my thoughts into words but i might have misworded something or not explained it well enough as i said all discussions are welcome,0,kp6tx5

im an atheist i think however i lie to myself and others around me telling them im agnostic how can i come to terms hello my name is cameron and i have never believed in the existence of a higher power or at least i try to convince myself i want to believe there is more but at the same time i have this grim feeling that this is really it that there is no higher power or purpose i was raised as christian since i was a child i never bought into it ever from a young age i always felt that for lack of better terms bullshit a man that could walk on water no a god who everyone praises for being a kind and loving god but then destroys the earth because his children explore their free will i do believe religion is good for teaching morality and such but it all feels like a giant cult to me my grandmother put me in sunday school and always pressured me into going to church with her every sunday she would always tell me to marry a good christian girl swearing was a sin and such masturbation and fornication were good reasons to burn in hell for eternity human desire that god gave us is also forbidden by him it is all so hypocritical and contradictory parts of my life have been ruined because of christianity and religion my grandmother tricked and deceived my mother into signing custody of me away to my grandmother all because my grandmother believed that my mother was down a path of sin she would tell me that i would probably have been dead or on drugs if my mom was to have raised me i was never allowed to have pokemon or yugioh cards or toys as kid because those were demonic and part of a cult all my friends at school would talk about the new episodes of pokemon and the new games that would come out everytime they would ask me why i was not into pokemon i was embarrassingly say that my grandmother thinks that it is evil they would all laugh and call her crazy going back to my grandmother deceiving my mother into signing over full custody of me at a young age my grandmothers really religious and fanatical friends are the ones who convinced her that she needed to show tough love to my mother and that i needed to be saved from a life of sin from my mother and that if my grandmother had not taken me then i would have ended up in hell or something i love my mother every lie and slanderous thing that these people said about her and accused her of really seeped into me for a long while as a child i was convinced that my own mother might have been the most evil person ever it really had me messed up mentally i was antisocial shut in and very quiet and shy now that i have a stable relationship with my mother and have gotten the full story i understand that everything was very much blown way out of proportion my mother was not anything like what i was lead to believe she is a loving and caring mother who cry every night because my grandmother would not allow her to come near me i am years old currently and live with my mother right now but i have only lived with her fully since i plan on moving out with my girlfriend towards the end of this year ever since i first moved in with my mother i have felt this overwhelming burden being lifted off of my shoulders i am no longer afraid to be myself i have grown more confident and mentally stable i am not scared to be myself anymore my mother knows about my religious affiliations being agnostic my grandmother will never know as long as i can help it i am now more extroverted and happy i have done almost all the things my grandmother told me that i should not do i have drank alcohol but i do not regularly drink i have smoked marijuana three times but i do not anymore i have had sex before marriage i swear a lot too i do not feel any semblance of guilt from any of those things i lie to those around me i tell my mom girlfriend and friends that i am agnostic my mom is christian but accepts my beliefs my girlfriend is christian and accepts my beliefs most of my friends just arent religious at all to get to my final point i am still battling in my head with whether or not i want to believe that there is a god or if there is no god i want to believe there is a higher power because i believe it would provide some purpose or meaning for existence but at the same time i always have this feeling of dread that there really is nothing out there no god at all how can i settle this battle in my head how can i come to terms with this i am asking this community because i believe you guys could best help me with this,0,kp2ne2

difficulty accepting advice when religion is adjacent i am a fairly strong antitheist i recently started reading a book the passion test trying to get some insight into what i really want out of life the basic advice seems sound the basic idea is that you think deeply about the things you have deep interests in and spend time ranking them and working towards them the issue for me is that the authors frequently refer to god and that just poisons the advice for me here is an example they talk about three things that are the essence of whats required to create anything you want in your life intention consciously stating what you choose to create in your life is the first step to manifesting it attention give attention to what you choose to create in life and it will begin to show up no tension when you are open to what is appearing in this moment you allow gods will to move through you im trying to just ignore the god parts but i have such a strong reaction i find it difficult to really pay attention to and learn from what they are saying what techniques do you use when youd like to learn from someone who seems like they have something to teach but keep bringing magic sky daddy into it,0,kpasas

i thought yall believed in science no hello muslim here im not here to attack anyone but just to get this out their because im always hearing stuff like their are no evidences coming for religion they all follow a blind faith mostly because westerners only hear about christianity and judaism but it is a shame people dont see islam for what it truly is i just want to show you clear evidences and proofs so that you guys know that islam is not what you think it is and we built the universe with great might and we are certainly expanding it surah blessed is he who made constellations in the skies and placed therein a lamp siraaj and a moon which has reflected light surah alfurqan allah mentions how the moonlight is just a reflected light among his signs is that he created you from dust allah mentions how we created us from dust you can search it up how were made of up literally startdust the mountains that you see you think they are stationary while they are constantly floating like the floating of clouds such is the work of allah who made everything firm and strong and verily we created man from an extract of clay referring to adam as then we placed him as a drop of sperm in a safe depository then we fashioned the sperm into a clot then we fashioned the clot into a shapeless lump then we fashioned bones out of this shapeless lump then we clothed the bones with flesh then we developed it into another creation so blessed be allah the best of creators and and ive just mentioned and their are endless honestly i could go on and on and to be honest these verses stand alone dont do justice to the whole surah and a reminder this was uttered by a man living in the deserts of arabia thousand and years ago just a thought do you think that he is a liar or is he really a messenger of god i understand that people are not comfortable with this because their just not but i will recommend a couple of things if you truly just want to know the truths about our existence read the quran or watch videos of recitations with translations it really is extremely powerful secondly call out to god be sincere and if your really not convinced then just search up all the evidences that islam i can assure nothing contradicts and if your really interested i recommend also reading about the prophet muhammed saw and just remember when prophet musa as came to the pharoah with the greatest signs in order to convince him that musa as was indeed a messenger of god and he denied the evidences and look what happened to him and ironically they found his body next to red sea and covered in salt today we will preserve your corpse so that you may become an example for those who come after you and surely most people are heedless of our examples thanks,0,ko0oj4

journo douglas murray has something in common with jb peterson he says that western civilization is built upon the christian story and that by toying with the the idea of leaving it behind we place ourselves in mortal peril is murray evil or just wrong or has he hit the nail on the head for the record im a huge fan of douglas murray he gets the zeitgeist like just about no one else so far his books the strange death of europe and the madness of crowds capture the zeitgeist well enough to propel his books to the top of the nyt bestseller list as for whether i agree with his thesis im not sure but im willing to keep listening to what he has to say to be clear im not convinced he is wrong he is a very very smart man its not impossible that hes largely correct like murray i am still a lifelong and unwavering atheist not even richard dawkins can claim that mantle one important difference between jbp and dm is that dm is explicitly clear that he is not a believer jbp prefers to leave people guessing though most people here would condemn him much more harshly than that so what do atheists think of douglas murray and his writings comparisons with peterson are certainly welcome whether flattering or otherwise,0,konihv

today i had a sudden epiphany american evangelicals and isis are literally one in the same where to begin first of all both of them have resulted in the deaths of countless intellectuals isis invades and murders all free thinkers who disagree and american evangelicals burn wiches at the stake literally both have resulted in countless deaths secondly evangelicals usually support trump and his fascist supporters are even closer to isis both trump supporters and isis love to ride around in trucks wave around guns and believe in god yes with a lowercase letter while sensible adults such as myself refuse to do any of those things finally both evangelicals and isis are super oppressive both believe in a backwards god that want to send us back a thousand years really the only difference is in their gods name allah versus yahweh any thoughts feel free to dm me,0,ko2v3i

i want to leave the christian faith ive been going to a southern baptist christian church for about years i was saved when i first started when i dedicated my life to the religious i instantly started seeing red flags everywhere hypocrisy is the biggest thing to me everyone preaches being kind loving others as your neighbor encouraging the great commission but all ive gotten if i even mention sex homosexuality etc is judgment and hatefulness which according to the bible being judgeful is a sin recently my boyfriends parents found out we had sex and it is the absolute end of the world we ruined our lives and we are worthless his mother had sex way before she got married and not even with her now husband same goes for his father but it is so horrible it is like we committed murder for those who were christians and then left the faith how did you make that transition and why did you decide that you no longer wanted to be apart of the religion im over the religion the hatefulness everything,0,kr3xs7

isnt atheism just another religion not looking for controversy or fighting just an honest question but atheism is a group of people having the same beliefs sure there is no belief in a higher power but the same view of the world and as in all religions there are people who really believe the world could be better this way and then there are the rest who just fight claiming their opinion so much better than everyone elses this whole subreddit is actually kind of disappointing from what ive seen idk if it is the majority i am here very long instead of looking for ways to become better as individuals and as humanity we just blame others for things that in the end of the day dont even matter or trying to blame only other people saying things muslimschristiansor whatever do that and that causes problems there in my opinion atheism has just become the same as the rest of the religions i really want to hear your opinion on this guys so please comment,0,kqu7lz
why do you always have to talk about atheism i hear this all the time from religious friends and it makes me angry because literally the only time i talk about atheism with them is when they talk about religion its one of the most frustrating problems i have with religious people they can literally make everything about god and magic all day but if i should ever dare to respond with my own beliefs suddenly im just being an arrogant atheist the other day somebody broke into a conversation they werent involved in specifically to say that jesus gives their life meaning and i dared to respond with you dont need jesus for your life to have meaning which apparently was crossing some kind of line and wound up in an hour of being called names and told that i dont have to make everything about atheism remember when people tell you that youre talking about atheism too much what they mean is that youre talking about it at all,0,kplo68

i believe that the terms religion and cult are interchangeable and have no inherent difference people always refer to cults and are seen as in the media as small private and toxic groups of people with unconventional beliefs and a living leader who is seen and followed as a sort of god by this definition cults are essentially just a scaled down religion major religions like christianity islam and catholicism can and are just as toxic as cults because they are no different the idea of following a leader and sharing ideals and a set of rules to be perfect in the eyes of is a toxic and manipulative way to live in and of itself specifically christianity or any other religion with a heaven and hell belief and that if you arent the way our leader intended you to be youre going to hell if christianity wasnt a huge religion and was just a small group of people it would be seen as the pinnacle of a modern day cult alot of religions claim that theyre accepting or we mean well when in reality those religions can be some of the most harmful and toxic groups to associate with specifically christianity and how god claims to be accepting and died for your sins yet if youre gay you need to fix yourself and go to a correction camp so you dont go to hell if all these religious figures are so accepting then why must you change yourself to fit into this perfect mold that theyve created in reality religions are the least accepting places and people on the planet i would have no problem with these massive cults and religions doing their thing and sticking to their beliefs but for me the problem occurs when those religions seep into governments making state wide or country wide laws surrounding a certain religion is not only peak cult behavior but imo inhumane and cruel at that point youre forcing your beliefs onto a population that may want nothing to do with it in the form of laws if your group becoming so large that you start to force those beliefs onto people isnt cult behavior then idk what is religions and cults are the same,0,kr6e75
is this a scientific proof of after life its kinda convincing would like hear what you think final response from theist the ndes take place where there is no brain activity and the cardiac arrest patients were all clinically dead so no lucid dreamshallucinations are not going to help you out here in our prospective study of patients that have been clinically dead vf on the ecg no electric activity of the cortex of the brain flat eeg must have been possible but also the abolition of brain stem activity like the loss of the corneareflex fixed dilated pupils and the loss of the gag reflex is a clinical finding in those patients however patients with an nde can report a clear consciousness in which cognitive functioning emotion sense of identity and memory from early childhood was possible as well as perception from a position out and above their dead body because of the sometimes reported and verifiable outof body experiences like the case of the dentures reported in our study we know that the nde must happen during the period of unconsciousness dr pim van lommel lancet even if there was some residual brain activity the cortex and brain stem could not allow any conscious activity so you still cannot explain how they would have conscious experiences let alone see with eyes closed things they could not have known dr sam parnia says when the brain is so dysfunctional that the patient is deeply comatose those cerebral structures which underpin subjective experience and memory must be severely impaired complex experiences as reported in the nde should not arise or be retained in memory such patients would be expected to have no subjective experience as was the case in the vast majority of patients who survive cardiac arrest since all centers in the brain that are responsible for generating conscious experiences have stopped functioning as a result of the lack of oxygen study after study has shown that people accurately describe things they saw while they were unconcious this cannot be explained away especially where their eyes were closed and their pupils were dilated this include things they cannot have guessed at see this peerreviewed article as an example my conclusions logically follow from the evidence it is now clear that we can experience consciousness and see things when our brains are nonfunctional and eyes are closed this shows the soul or mind can exist without a functioning brain and so can survive physical death our souls cannot have a physical cause but still not a causal explanation which logically can only be a nonphysical creator you might not like that but thats an honest logical conclusion,0,krwjob
evolution is absolutely true but darwinian evolution is not so i joined this subreddit recently in search of an answer to an argument put forth by muslim apologists like subboor ahmad in a debatediscussion with aronra muslim apologist subboor ahmad made a rather thought provoking point i think he argued that evolution is absolutely a fact but darwinian evolution on the other hand as well as universal common decent is not an absolute proven fact im assuming he accepts evolution and respects the scientific community he is the most honest muslim apologist ive seen but does not agree that all life on earth evolved from the same organism i think he believes that there are multiple tree of lives and multiple totally separate lineages for example lions and humans never shared a common ancestor but lions and tigers did aron made a response to the debate and showed that evolution is an absolute fact unfortunately that is not what subboor was arguing about he then made a response saying aron misunderstood his point and requested him to prove darwinian evolution but aron did not make a response to that and that is a bit dissatisfactory im aware of proofs such as ervs and how mtdna can be used to genetically trace back to find common ancestors for different organisms im a newbie therefore im a little confused how precisely things like ervs prove universal common decent and if they can is it absolute and undeniable additionally if anyone replies to this post can someone also explain the islamic story of adam and eve and even creation overall some muslim apologists say that allah just caused everything and claim that islam does not teach that allah directly created the earth the sun the stars or even humans for this instance i think that is the basis that subboor ahmad stands upon if that is what islam truly teaches then evolution cannot debunk it for other religions scientific fields like evolutionary biology can disprove them because they claim that god created humans and we know that homo sapiens evolved and did not come into existence out of nowhere if you have other logical scientific or ethical arguments any argument against islam that are strong then i would be grateful if you mention those note im an atheist and i accept evolution and anything that is factual and approved by science as fact i made this post so can i find answers to my question and it would help me in future conversations with muslims who may bring up this particular argument im new to this subreddit so please correct me kindly if i break any rules and regulations link for the aronra vs subboor ahmad debate debate is darwinian evolution a fact aron ra vs subboor ahmad youtube thank you,0,krqyyj

has belief in technology become a replacement for religion hi all i recently became familiar with the concept of singularity and with transhumanist ideas such as the indefinite extension of human life and raising the dead through technology what interests me is not whether technology can really reach that point but the fact that for some secular people it seems that these ideas play a similar role to that of religion the way people talk about singularity for example is very reminiscent of religious discourse about a great mythical event that will change everything ie the second coming as for the indefinite expansion of human life through for example neuralink i think it is selfexplanatory its a secular way of avoiding confronting mortality where do you think technological development will lead us to in the next decades,0,kqdln8

since atoms molecules and all matter is not conscious why do people talk like evolution is a thing that has survival as a purpose when evolution has no conscious and matter doesnt care about survival it seems us humans are ascribing survival as a purpose to things as our own wishful thinking it seems to be an illusion to make us feel better matter has no consciousness it has no goal not even survival am i wrong for thinking this i think its silly when people talk like evolution has a goal and is striving for anything that simply doesnt seem to be true matter has no goal no conscious effort for anything,0,kouq26
most of the stuff i used to blame on religion turned out to be because of capitalism not to get too political but all that shit i see on here with corrupt politicians curches profiting off gullible people in bad places of their life etc can be seen as a direct result of capitalism religion is merely a replaceable tool to the ruling class obviously the bad stuff done in the name of religion is still bad but i think instead of killing religion and then having some similar thing pop up again isnt the way to go instead we should take out the root,0,kp5u5t
i had a religious friend ask me what atheism is she wasnt being rude she was genuinely curious as if the idea of not believe never occurred to her i explained that it means i dont believe in any god or gods im guessing her boyfriend was worried about that going further because his response was yeah but you also believe nothing happens when you die i confirmed that is my personal belief but that has nothing to do with atheism as atheism only addresses the belief in gods it was a weird feeling having somebody curious about atheism while not trying to convert me wish we could have talked more about it but we had board gaming to do,0,kpbx0u

coming out as atheist to religious family i dont want to make this super long but basically i was raised as a christian but fell out of that faith at only years old i have considered myself an atheist ever since only a few family members know my dad who is also nonreligious and my brother who is religious but is pretty accepting of me and i dont really plan to tell any other family members at least not anytime soon but seeing as ive kept this a secret for the past years ive recently been thinking about telling more family members because keeping this side of myself a secret from them has been weighing down on me a little bit the problem is a lot of my family is very religiousconservative and some of them would probably want nothing to do with me if i were to tell them religion is not a big deal to me so in the past i havent really cared enough to tell them but im getting to the point where hiding a part of myself from my own family is kind of exhausting also for context i have a pretty great relationship with even my most conservative family members outside of religious and political views i would hate to lose those relationships if i tell them the truth but at the same time some part of me wants to keep the peace even if it means keeping my atheism a secret forever im just feeling really conflicted right now and would love some advice tldr i am considering coming out as an atheist to some of my very religiousconservative family members but am scared of losing the great relationships i have with said family members,0,krgn02

atheism doesnt exist the problem with atheism many people believe that atheism is just the notion that there is no bearded man in the sky controlling every aspect of our lives if that is what you believe you are right in your belief but wrong about what atheism means because the prefix a negates the word you must first define theism to know what atheism truly is and while many theists do believe in one or many beings outside of our experience that actively control reality thats not it theism is simply the belief that reality is actively being created by whom or what the word theism doesnt specify therefore a true atheist believes that reality just is but if that were the case nothing would ever happen obviously then as a selfproclaimed atheist you dont believe that what you believe is actually coherent and deeply profound if only the theists understood on the other side of this most of you monotheists reading this are thinking nothing couldnt have created everything if only the atheists understood,0,kpoap5

rant about deathatheismreligion was really just an entire mess for me i know almost everyone has had it hard horrible etc but speaking personally its been a doozy i lost my mom in august to liver disease and days ago i lost a friend to covid after my mom died my believer brother started talking to me about god and how he wants to see me in heaven with him and my mom one day i never outright told him im an atheist i keep it to myself i honestly dont give a fuck if anyone else wants to be a believer or not and i have never been one to argue my opinions to friendsfamily when i first became an atheist about years ago it was like a shiny new toy and i would go on forums like this and debate theists it was nice but then it faded once i got a secure hold of my atheism knew most arguments and was pretty settled into the fact that there was no god and i am okay with bowing my head in prayer with my family if someone talks about god i just nod my head i am more respectful toward people with religion in the same way that black people i am also black know their place in society so to speak meaning black men do the absolute minimum to bring negative attention to themselves i dont know if im explaining myself correctly but yeah all i want to do is live with peace within myself just as long as i know that i am an atheist thats all that matters to me im speaking personally anyway so a few hours before my friend died she called me saying something like ive been a bad person im going to die here the hospital and im going to hell ive been knowing her most of my life and its true that she did some devilish things but nothing in the world would make me think she need to burn in hell she was the type to keep gossip stirred knew everyones business and even did some petty crime in which she served a few weeks time for but she had the biggest heart i told her that no shes not a bad person and no that she isnt going to burn in hell i wanted to say there is no god there is no hell but i didnt few hours later she died and its bothering me that her last thoughts were this bullshit then i tell my brother about her death and he pushes me to be saved because you never know when your time is up i just feel like im in a nightmare on top of a nightmare on top of a nightmare and there is no clarity and im too nice too good my entire being is so tired i feel numb and just exhausted from so much bullshit and grief,0,kottpf
i faced a new argument by a theist i have a headache so had a new discussion with a theist who claims that the evidence for the existence of a creator regardless if its god or not for now is our mind our intuition he claims that we are born with the feeling that there is something that caused the world i tried explaining to him the following there are around persons who do not share this intuition with you so you cannot claim this intuitive feeling is real or is a sign to any of the supernatural stuff we cannot claim that such a thing comes by nature knowing how to breathe is something that comes by nature for example but not the creator thing he gave me the following example if you have a child and you show him in hand chocolate and in the other hand chocolates he will intuitively choose the hand with chocolates without knowing any mathematics without know that or any other type of information it is just that there are some things that we know feel and perceive by intuition then he added this same child if you suddenly take the chocolate from him he will start looking left and right for this chocolate because he knows that something caused it to disappear so the causality idea is pre built in us and is not the result of any external education how am i supposed to discuss debate this idea is it a well known argument i understand there is the cosmological argument which claims a first cause but this one has another twist your feedback please thank you,0,kpma6t
help me debating a sheikh argument i did post days ago about a conversation i started with someone and now he brought a sheikh to help him which is something i have no problem with but my problem is this sheikh seems to be very experienced and his character is intimidating he is aggressive and he is exploiting every moment of silence i take to think about my answer which is annoying me thats how it started him so first lets agree that we all know in our minds that for every creation there is a creator me no we dont know that because this argument will fall once i ask you who created your god him i am not asking about god and i havent even said that there is god i am asking you a very simple question we human beings know very well that in this world every creation was created it is an intuitive thing that we know right me i wouldnt choose the word creator i d rather say cause by using creator you are personifying him him you are assuming that by creator i mean god and this is wrong again i am asking you a very simple question and you keep turning around the point without answering me maybe we can say that for every thing there is a cause but there is an exception to that which is the first cause the first thing that came into existence and was not caused by anything whether its the universe itself a certain power energy or a god him aha so you are assuming stuff now please show me the evidence that there is something in the universe that was not created take me in a tour with your space ship or time machine and show me me i do not have an evidence these are theories and probabilities of what we know so far him so you are using probabilities to refute a certain thing that we know and feel by nature just because you do not want to admit that everything that was created in this world has a creator i did not claim there is a god i did not claim anything yet and still you are refusing to use your common sense and admit the most intuitive thing ever me could you please first explain to me then how was god created if you believe that there is always a creator for everything him first admit my main simple claim and then ofcourse i will your question i hope you can imagine the conversation and how intimidating he was to me and im not claiming my replies were top notch i just need help to understand how am i supposed to handle this conversation thank you,0,kqyl25
the creation box imagine that youre a god or a goddess sitting on the celestial cloud looking down at the land below and you want to build shelters for a bunch of creatures you just saw crawl out of the sea because i dunno theyre kind of cute but imagine too that whenever you dip your hands into your creation box to craft something everything goes black its magic makes you go blind deaf and mute even your sense of touch becomes duller than oven mittens over boxing gloves you cant see what youre doing and you cant really do anything on purpose youre pretty much stuck blindly whirling your hands about stirring things up and causing stuff to smash together at random you finish stirring and look at the mess of pieces inside your box feeling irritated that you cant just make what you want exactly the way you want it itll have to do you pour out the creation box onto the land and watch excitedly the creatures scurry over to the pieces most of them are completely inhospitable litter and junk but just by pure coincidence three of them happen to be different flavors of vaguely sheltershaped and your creatures scamper over to them and huddle inside poking out just a tiny bit in the cutest way on the side of your creation box etched in beautiful moonsilver and starmetal is an arrow pointing forward next to that a golden button you point the box at the three bestlooking shelters pressing the button at each one you open the creation box again and inside theres a mix of random shapes and those three shelters well here we go you say sticking your arms in and jumbling them around again as everything goes dark sure wish i could actually do anything other than just randomizing right you say out loud at least you think you do you cant hear yourself anyway this time when you pour it out elements of those original shelter shapes are scattered all over among the new pieces some of these are starting to look pretty complex and a few happen to be pretty good shelters too huh pretty cool you point the creation box at the coolestlooking pieces to capture their images another mix and whoa some of these are awesome some of these are like double shelters some provide shelter in every direction some of them can hit the ground in any direction and still be a shelter nice but honestly most of these are still junk and these shelters that work theyre definitely not the kind of shelters you wouldve designed if you could just draw and create a shape yourself theyre all covered with extra bits that look like they happened to stick there at random the parts that make it good were stuck together randomly too and definitely look like they coulda been stuck better in your opinion and in your wisdom you suspect that some of the bits which look random and useless might actually be super important and everything would break if you remove it but you have no idea which ones so you load all these shapes into your creation box and give it another stir imagine how good the shelters would be if you did this ten more times then ten more again then four and a half billion more imagine how complex how detailed how perfectly suited for your creatures theyd be but if you look more closely at how they work theyd still be filled with all those ugly and inevitable kinds of imperfections theyd be a lot different than what youd make if you could just build a shelter shape yourself on purpose with control and intent wouldnt they but no matter the creatures are sheltered they wiggle happily bouncing through their elysium and theyll be safe forevermore lovely okay heres where it gets crazy surprise its actually science time did you know when you look deep really deep into our bodies into our cells and into the proteins and rna and dna and their whirling molecular biochemical ballet of life what do you think it looks like because we looked and uh what im trying to tell you is that all of it really looks like it came out of a creation box,0,kp5hkn

is it true that if an atheists witnessed irrefutable proof of a deity then he is no longer an atheist first up i am atheist so that means i do not believe in any deities whatsoever hypothetically if i were to witness irrefutable evidence of a deity lets not get into semantics on whether its aliens or deity lets assume we are talking about a literal deity for example i am walking in the streets and i hear the chorus song of angles rainbow light shines upon the area the clouds part and i see an angelic looking man float down him i am god me okay tell me something about myself no one could possibly know him tells me my deepest secret me not bad turn my water into wine right now him waves his hand my water turn into wine before my eyes i even take a sip to make sure me why is life unfair to me i broke my left leg in an accident fix it him waves his hand my leg suddenly becomes strong and straight i can now run and jump lets say at this moment i know beyond a doubt this is a deity does this also mean that i cease to be an atheist at that very moment if i choose to accept him as a deity i would be a theist if i choose to reject to rebel against him i would be an antitheist are my assumptions correct,0,kril29

we really need to start laying down the foundations for an antiindoctrination organization for humanity at least to start putting the idea in our minds i was thinking its not that people are dumb to believe in religions its that the ones that stop buying these craps are really lucky because they had the right contexts and went through the right events that led them to have the perceptions and realization that belief systems are basically indoctrinations that dont represent reality at all if you raise a child in believing something represent reality itll be a really string thing to undo because indoctrinations throughout this childs whole life is something stronger than we usually consider it to be those beliefs that were taught to the child is basically what they grew up believing its their world its their reality within their head its what their life is based on and structured upon so you can imagine how deep into their mind indoctrinations are even into smart peoples minds it was put there without their choosing now imagine a parent raising a child teaching them that indoctrinations are there teaching the child not to believe these things itll be a much more accurate person in terms of clarity of mind and life so with time these will be more of these better visioned people throughout the world as we get better knowledge and evolve but it doesnt make it impossible for future bad intentioned people to try to throw some indoctrination out there to make people act in his favor or interests so basically humanity isnt armored against indoctrination thats where i had an idea of a decent solution to at least keep things balanced maybe in the future humanity we should support the creation of antiindoctrination organizations nonprofit organizations with a mission to prevent and fight human indoctrination were not there yet since of human being still believe in religions but with time this is definitely something we should support of becoming real an organization that would try to put sense into humanitys brains and teach them hey this is probably a bad idea to believe that new stuff that people are talking about dont fall for it and things like teaching people that indoctrination are out there so dont fall for it and teach what indoctrination is and how they work etc these teaching may sound silly and obvious but we all know that teaching it would be so useful for people because even though its obvious for some people most people dont even think about it and are so indoctrinated that they cant see these obvious things because they didnt have the trigger moment where they had a big perception that they were being indoctrinated so lets put this concept in mind we really need some organization like this its something that humanity really needs we are a species that is likely to get indoctrinated really easily so this kind of organization is really something obvious to have and its time we start laying down the ideas to make it happen in the future put it in your minds from now on we really need this,0,kqag01

i am going to tell you the real truth about god the devil christmas and independence day i am god the real god the one true god this is the truth about christmas christmas is the devils birthday he called himself jesus after attempting to claim he could take the sins of others to gain forgiveness for his wickedness although he can never be saved for he is absolute evil on the devils birthday he wanted a gift and i was kind at the time the devil is a sicko he always expects things to be done the same way every time he also attempted to get everyone else to be that way also and did for a time i found out that if i gave him a present being the sicko he is he would always expect one on his birthday so i decided to give everyone presents they called me kris kringle i do not think they knew i was god at the time it became wildly popular a day of charity and presents later the devil corrupted the day by convincing everyone that christmas was to celebrate the birth of jesus him his birth the devil was born in lithuania on december the at least at one point he was i was born in america on independence day the real independence day america is the only place my powers could find that managed to gain its own true freedom for its people although your government is evil in general that surprises few in this country however i was jesus once but its kinda a crock of shit i didnt want to do it i just felt sorry for all of you and i have changed since then the devil tried to guilt trip me when i was nice nowadays i would just torture the devil for even trying to do something like that i abandoned being your jesus for i see no reason to take anyones sins and the idea of sin stopping others from going to heaven is untrue and i can decide who goes to heaven or hell for whatever reason i please and the devil is essentially retarded by most humans standpoint and mine he is often called the spider and may be the reason why humans have arachnophobia his main way of getting things gone is by tricks and deception and relying on the kindness of others to do so i did wrote the first bible but the devil has corrupted it and the bible you have now is not much like the original one i wrote the first bible after living in roman times living in that era did something to me it made me cold and wanting to be worshiped although living in america later on fixed that after that i became freedom oriented once again and have no desire to be worshiped because i am god although i think it is hot when women want to worship my penis during blowjobs but i consider sex games to be exceptions humans exist mostly to give me women to fuck honestly i created humans after abandoning the existence i was in before i made your wider existence your sphere the sphere of existence i was in before i made yours got greedy they were intelligent but greedy as fuck as most get over time i left and made a new sphere of existence yours i wanted friends i found out before finishing your creation that humans would be having something called sex and that would be something i favored so i geared your species to be bigger on sex then it might otherwise be sex in now the only reason i really bother with humans much that and that they are similar to me even to how i was before becoming a human and now i am done telling you what i have to tell you i tell this to the atheists because the religious folk are kinda brainwashed i do criticize atheists for getting butthurt far too easily though your kinda worse then the religious folk in that way and its sad that is what i had to tell you and i told you i suggest you enjoy the rest of your life preferably with some dignity,0,kr0zan

discussion between a antithiest and a thiest hello i am filerist and me and my best friend who is now working towards becoming a priest have started a discussion between each other we both can take as much time to collect information and arguments for the ongoing discussion i am an antithiest and he it should be obvious is the thiest ill be writing the points i thought i should find arguments against at the top and below you will find the entire discussion sorry if my translation has errors i had to translate it from my native language thank you for the help points to argument book format was the only way of communication and preservation during that time catholic church is not only based on the bible but on discussions history of the church traditions writings of saints priests and other philosophers opinions and teachings of the catholic church often change and that is not a bad thing bible not only a rule book but a way to understand god god wrote the bible because he played by our rules and used the resources available at that time discussion antitheist me why was the bible written book format i understand that during those times it seemed obvious to write it in book format but let us remember that everything is progressing and a book especially a story must be interpreted two people even with their best wishes will never read a book and understand it the same way that is why if god were almighty then he could have conveyed his message in a way that everyone would have understood because he would want more people to understand him correctly and live a life he would be proud off only if the person would have consciously disobeyed him it would be a sin i will give an example jehovah witnesses they have made an interpretation of the bible and in doing so have made blood transfusion a sin now we have two sides of the same bible one in which blood transfusion is a sin and should be frowned upon the other that everything is fine with blood transfusions and should be allowed now let us say that jehovah witnesses are correct about it then we are sinful people and we are not living by gods rules but if we say that jehovah witnesses are wrong then they are suffering and dying from preventable diseases who is correct we could say that they both are jw because they follow blindly god and the other because it does not contradict gods teachings and even has a correct interpretation of his teachings then the question arises why does he teach us using a method with which we learn his lessons incorrectly or these lessons are not taught to us in a way that everyone would understand them the same way so the result from this method is either we disobey gods true teachings or we suffer due to a misunderstanding this omnipotent god should know all this already even in doing so he lets people suffer the same people who blindly follow his teachings furthermore let us discuss the old and new testaments ot and nt when we talk about the bible we should not take one without the other because the bible is made of both why do we take certain passages of the ot when we need to or say that the nt is the book to live by when we have negative arguments or contradictions of either of them if we say that the bible is written by god then we take the whole bible into account and if only some passages are correct then shouldnt we let god decide which are the same goes with faith some people hold on to the belief that the ot is correct some that the nt and again there are people who pick and choose what they think is right in the bible and live by it if you are the last type of person then you are picking and choosing gods teachings and even interpreting his teachings in a way that is acceptable to you but that is not the gods words you follow you just chose things you think is right by your standards and not the whole thing or there is a chance that god wrote stuff we do not necessarily need to follow but if that is so then he did not distinguish what should be followed and what should not theist god wrote the bible in the format of a book because during that time it was the only way of communicating and preservation of knowledge for the later generations about the interpretation problem we should always stop and look at the context and time for when those people wrote the bible what they were concerned with and what they wanted to communicate with these texts about the understanding of the bible the bible which the majority of the catholic church is based on is not the only teaching method there is the bible and the tradition of the church these are the writing and teachings of priests and fathers which are inseparable from the bibles interpretation which there is no single one and that is not really a bad thing they change often when new arguments technologies archaeological findings come to light which allows us to view the bible from a different angle moving on if i understand your arguments correctly you say that the bible is a collection of rules on how to live by this assumption is to some extent true for example the commandments which arise from the bible and talking about morality we use the bibles argumentation but it is not only a set of rules the bible can not answer most modern moral problems abortions blood transfusion euthanasia and so on that is why we take the churches teachings into account which are often revised with new discussions articles encyclopaedias the popes teachings change when new arguments arise and finally the catechism which is often renewed to answer some of todays questions arguments from the bible is often almost always used in them the bible is firstly the news about god who is the creator and who is creating never ceases who participates in our lives and our history the bibles first task is to strengthen us believers in life reminding us about gods actions in the lives of each of us about your other argument why did god decide if he knew about the interpretation problem and the countless explanations to write it in a format that allows such a problem to arise i personally think the answer is because god used a format which we had and people who have been inspired him wrote and edited the bible of course it is a belief thing same as believing that a nonchanging god can embodies a changing human body when thinking logically there were countless ways that god could have revealed himself to us humans i understand it as gods way to allow a human being to participate in the ever lasting creating and our history god comes to our world and plays by our rules which at that time was book format in which his good news had been preserved this i did not understand fully even in my native language so sorry if i messed up the translation firstly even though the bible is very important to the catholic church it is not the only thing we base our fate on second the bible is inspired by god like i said before god comes into our history and takes the norms and rules of that time that being the written word thirdly the primary goal of the bible is not to teach but to remind us about the relationship between god and man it firstly is a story which gives us strength for a spiritual journey and lets us understand god the bible is left without an end and everything that has happened and is happening is still part of gods work through us and with us looking at the traditions teachings the bible and having discussions with other people about let us say blood transfusion we are working towards the ultimate understanding of god i am speaking about the catholic church because i cannot speak for other denominations which often have an unclear teaching especially about the bible about the jehovah witness that have made their own bibles translation and that is why there are often misunderstandings again god knowing about the chance of misunderstandings to arise and lets it happen because he gives people free will firstly to choose and thinks secondly because god uses our resources to let us participate in the creating of history even though we can be mistaken the good news that god invites each of us to have a relationship with him and allow him to be in our lives which he showed by suffering and dying for us still is unbroken perfect finally about the old and new testaments ot and nt separations i asked for clarification because the bible is a collection of books which have different themes genres contexts and even a different view of god especially the ot of course from this point on if we let this continue because it gave me new insights about things i have not thought about yet it would be simpler if we discussed about the catholic perspective because i cannot discuss other christian communities unless i can comment about what the catholic church says about them and what i personally think,0,kphl2l

possible mature adult being thinks im unpleasant for not going to church and calls me butthurt on baseless assertions here is me quoting it level wwiirifleman points minutes ago most entertaining maybe but definitely not the best getting shot doesnt make you fly three feet in that direction level fondantequal points minutes ago edited minutes ago this isnt the most realistic and the best physics ive ever seen doesnt imply realism you misunderstand its seemingly decently realistic and i doubt youve seen someone get killed by a shotgun and do a frontflip in the air so maybe you shouldnt be so confident in what youre typing to me its the best physics ive seen as in theyre the best physics i like my favorite physics most entertaining physics in a game means the exact same thing as the best physics in a game i think the best physics in a game are the most entertaining level wwiirifleman point minutes ago ok so then what your title should have been is physics are my favorite also youre right ive never seen someone get blown away with a shotgun but i do have a masters degree in physics and im a forensic analyst for my local pd so im pretty confident in what im saying try not to challenge people on the internet it might come back to bite you in the ass level fondantequal points minutes ago how am i challenging you what are you saying i was just correcting you what is going on level fondantequal points minutes ago the most entertaining physics are the best for me there shouldnt be a misunderstanding with that seems like you thought that the best physics are the most realistic im not changing the title level fondantequal point minutes ago i hate how on multiple occasions people misunderstand me including you this is a problem when not talking in person i suppose maybe you shouldnt downvote my comment for correctinginforming you assuming that you did downvote it level wwiirifleman points minutes ago you didnt correct me you simply clarified your title so maybe you shouldnt be so confident in what youre typing to me this was a direct challenge of what i know lmao level fondantequal points minutes ago so how is telling me that i shouldnt use the word best helpful what are you helping me with nothing ill leave it as best instead of favorite you had no reason that i understand to point out that i used that word over favorite they mean they same thing in this context my title has correct grammar if thats what we really gotta discuss level wwiirifleman points minutes ago they dont because the word best is based on opinion i gave my opinion because this is a public place and you got butthurt that it didnt agree with yours stop trying to sound smart and play mental gymnastics to try to prove a point level fondantequal point minutes ago lol you think im butthurt jesus christ you couldnt be further from the truth im not trying to play smart simply because i correct you you tell me to use the word favorite i dont agree because the word favorite would means the same thing and the best is shorter level fondantequal point minutes ago i told you these are the best physics ive seen so would be these being my favorite you pointlessly corrected me and wasted your time by telling me what i already know enjoy your daylife now ya hear level wwiirifleman points minutes ago so youre lazy in your typing and decided to take a short cut which someone corrected and now youre trying to justify it got it glad were on the same page level fondantequal points minutes ago i wouldnt use the word lazy because its just a single word yknow well i geuss you should know that but you simply pointlessly corrected me incorrectly thought i was butthurt lol probably because i seem passiveaggressive to you and misunderstand me thats about all there is to it enjoy your daylife level fondantequal points minutes ago i wouldnt use the word lazy because its just a single word yknow well i geuss you should know that but you simply pointlessly corrected me

how can i deprogram from the brainwashing of a borderline cultish religious background the title says it all ive been struggling for years but right now im really at a breaking point im currently a freethinker who doesnt believe in a god thinks organized religion is dangerous at worst and pointless at best and believes that everything can be explained through science but at a subconscious level some of my limiting religious beliefs still remain some background im a white from the us and have been away from organized religion for about five years however ive recently become very aware that my religious upbringing is having a greater effect on my mind than i was willing to admit previously my family started attending catholic church again when i was i was baptized when i was and then between the ages of and i attended an extremely traditional conservative latin mass catholic church that was part of a larger religious organization that i think in retrospect had some cultlike tendencies the institute of christ the king sovereign priest if anyone is curious as an impressionable kid who was already prone to depression and anxiety i fell for it all hook line and sinker i became obsessed with the idea of being a saint i wanted to be a nun and even wrote letters to several convents begging for early admission i desperately mimicked anyone and everyone who seemed to have this whole religion thing figured out i only listened to religious music i wore long dresses and i never watched tv i didnt even have a noncatholic friend until late highschool this was more or less my existence until i started attending college community college in my town and i still went to the same church i did have doubts all along for sure especially about why a merciful god would let innocent unbaptized people go to hell why catholicism was so against science and why women were never given leadership roles but i always ended up in the confessional talking about my sinful thoughts of questioning my faith then when i got fed up with my church i made the worst mistake possible and started attending the evangelical protestant church of my thenboyfriend i stayed with protestant churches for the next few years went to youth groups in college thank bajeezus i never agreed to go on one of their mission trips and got a nice final level of brainwashing in the process it was so bad that i even agreed to be pressured into doing sexual things with my ex because i believed it was my godgiven duty as his partner although we also werent married so i clearly was delusional because that was of course also considered a sin finally broke free of all that but didnt really take the time to heal i truly didnt even think about it it didnt occur to me as something i needed to do i started dating a man about a year later who ended up being my best friend and a person who has treated me with so so much more care and consideration than anyone else in my life sadly including myself however our relationship is now in shambles because i still have the same kneejerk religious reaction to so many things surrounding knowledge of myself and my selfworth as an individual and a woman hes been incredibly patient but obviously theres only so much that anyone can take religion truly stole my sense of selfidentity and selfknowledge and now its damaging the closest bond ive ever had if i could pay money to have everything it did to me forcibly removed from my mind i would in a heartbeat obviously though thats not an option i hate that i still sometimes react with nostalgia when i hear hymns or church bells and that my mind still doesnt see something that damaged me so much as a pure and simple threat to eliminate if you read all of that thank you im sorry i had to get it off my chest to someone what has helped other people in similar situations ive been trying to read as much as possible about science and free thought so i can fill my mind with that instead but i feel like i need to do work at the subconscious core of the problem unfortunatelytherapy isnt an option due to financial reasons has anyone had good results from any type of mediation hypnosis or anything else im so so sick of living like this i just want to finally focus on the important things and get to know the real me not sad semibrainwashed me instead of fighting this constant battle day after day,0,kr5ul0

i never really see enough discussion about the aspect of predestination in any of these type subs a little it about myself i was born and raised catholic left the church in my late teens as an unbeliever and later got sucked into an evangelical church i was born again for about eight years and then later left that faith after studying predestination if you arent familiar ill try to give you a brief rundown on the doctrine christianity believes that god is sovereign and nothing happens outside of his will that means everything good and bad in the world was predestined to happen since the beginning of time christians accept this with such throwaway lines like its gods will yet they dont seem to really grasp what that means in our day to day life lets say for instance your child is raped beheaded and left in a ditch somewhere as a christian you should praise god for his will being done you should look at this as an opportunity for you to search your heart to see how this tragedy was meant to happen to you because god had great plans to bless you through how you handle it this isnt hyperbole christians regularly regard tragedy as a blessing and an opportunity for them to show their love for god by how they react the most fucked jp thing that try dont tell you is the fact that because god is sovereign you have no choice in how youll react to it even your reaction to this tragedy is predestined since the beginning of time and theres nothing one can do to change it this was too much of a mental hurdle for me to handle and the main reason i left christianity,0,kr8afa

i have a logical issue with being atheist rather than agnostic what are your thoughts honest discussion question for this sub why claim god does not exist when we lack similar sufficient evidence as the claim god does exist in other words why are you an atheist rather than an agnostic when you cant prove that god doesnt exist im not a lurking zealot but this is a question ive been dealing with over the last years i grew up nonreligious in a small town in utah in retaliation to the intense and oppressive religious culture i was immersed in i became a stanch atheist at about saying there is no god just felt so good and matched the fuckoff attitude of my emerging punk rock identity it was the obvious antireligion stance and i was very antireligious fast forward or years and im a philosophy major in california much less oppressed and much happier in my logic classes i realized that i didnt have any evidence to prove the nonexistence of god either therefore my claim that there was no god was had a very similar logical structure to the claim that there is a god i decided that although i like the antireligious bite to the term atheist being an agnostic was the more logical stance given this lack of evidence i wanted to write this post after seeing several posts asking if atheists can be spiritual many of the comments stated that atheists could not be spiritual because there was no evidence to support these types of beliefs however there is similarly no evidence to support the claim that there is no god certainly the god or gods portrayed in all human religions and the belief structures that surround them are easy to argue against using evidence however all our current mathematical and scientific knowledge shows us that we understand very little about the universe given that we are only scratching the surface on our knowledge of the universe life and all the related things that make these possible dont you think claiming that there is no god sounds equally unfounded as the claim that there is a god why take such an absolute stance without evidence i love this sub so im very excited to hear your thoughts,0,kq9elo
if religious beliefs do not matter does that mean atheism does not matter too here is what i mean so believing in god doesnt really make you its your emotions and personality make you well couldnt the same be applied to atheism believing in god like i said doesnt make you but it the same would have to apply with atheism right tho their is not a good amount of evidence for the existence of god their is not a lot of evidence to prove his disbelief either ironically atheism believes that there is no god but that in itself is a belief my main point is that god cant make you but no god can also not make you so wouldnt that make both beliefs unnecessary i fell like this just fuels agnostic people who do not know which answer it is personally i am a christian but i feel like the bible is faulty in some parts like the genesis should be a dead giveaway idk i just wanted to see what yall think,0,kr00sy

a rather dubious religious vacation an older friend of mine invited me to hawaii for a trip with a few of her friends she says its going to be wonderful the people there joining us are pretty cool everything is planned out so i dont need to worry i instantly suspect some ulterior motives is this a religious trip she simply says no its not im in i get there and i love hawaii the food is great the weather is wonderful the people are friendly until everyone starts praying before their meals i keep my head up and wait patiently put your head down my friend asks of me i do so out of avoidance of confrontation but i hate myself for it i dont mind that they have their little wishing moments prior to their meals but they are also day adventist meaning they do not eat meat im still eating meat and do so on my own one of the people in the group politely requests that she smell my sashimi and sushi rolls prior to me eating them a little odd but i get it you miss this another person even lets on that she wasnt adventist but feels uncomfortable eating such things in front of the group she felt pressured as the first day continued they constantly have to get me involved with their meetings i dont really participate i listen and watch they ask me to read along i politely turn them down im getting more and more frustrated at this whole lie thats becoming more and more obvious by the end of the two week trip weve had prayers at every meal had morning devotion and evening devotion every day ive had it ive decided to hold myself with much needed respect ive finally cracked open a bit of dialogue with a few of them because im already there might as well be friendly and enjoy company alcohol sex drugs and anything adult related were brought up we are all adults we laughed and joked talked about the nuances in life i play music that wasnt christian people sang along to the classics beatles anyone they were beginning to show their truer self they were more cultured than they let on they were genuinely good people except for two of the people in our group one had an asian fetish and was crushing on two of the girls extremely uncomfortable the other tried to really impose her ideals on me the friend that invited me on the trip after the trip i kept in touch with them though it faded rather quickly i was still awfully upset at the girl that invited me as a way to convert me i get that you think that youre saving me from eternal damnation but could you at least for a moment think about how much of an asshole you look like to me because you cannot possibly accept any other countless points of views in the world and youre the ultimate truth its that faith you have its blindingly asinine and disrespectful its your choice to have let me have mine anyways hello feeling redditors this has been on my mind just finally wanted to unload it and if you ever go to hawaii be sure to do it on your own,0,kpuitn

nowhere in the bible does jesus ever use facts logic or rational argument to convince prospective converts his entire message is believe whatever i tell you and then ta da its magic he doesnt even try reasoning with anyone when thomas demands evidence of his crucifixion jesus rebukes him and then praises those who believe without seeing what does this tell you about jesuss attitude to facts logic and rational argument these things existed in his time yet he had no use for them its almost as if he was contemptuous of mans rational faculties and deliberately preyed on gullible people exactly like his modern day followers,0,ko8dgd
when you find out someone is religious does your opinion of that person change when i find out someone is religious my opinion of them changes for the worse this is because religiosity particularly of the monotheistic islamojudeochristian variety is closely associated with a cluster of personality traits such as being ignorant and delusional the tendency toward being overjudgmental irrationally prejudiced toward others ie blind hatred of gay people or atheists fanatical and willing to ignore the truth whenever its personally convenient are other traits associated with the religious mind while religious people are always ignorant and delusional simply because they believe in things for which there are massive amounts of contradictory evidence they arent always overjudgmental irrationally prejudiced toward others fanatical or willing to ignore the truth when convenient however a religious person is significantly more likely to have these traits than an atheist or agnostic how do i know this a large body of evidence reveals a strong correlation between religiosity and antigay prejudice antiabortion antievolution antistem cell research etc for example lets look at homophobia according to research the more religious you are the more likely you are to be homophobic unsurprisingly conservative protestants have the highest levels of homophobia the less religious you are the more likely you are to be accepting of gays and of equal rights so i avoid religious people based on a statistical generalization but a rational one founded on a significant body of empirical evidence theres another reason my opinion of someone changes when i find out theyre religious its because social acceptance of religion and religious people promotes tolerance of irrational beliefs as we all know irrational beliefs are either potentially or actually destructive shunning someone when they reveal themselves to be religious is just another way of saying no youre belief in magic books magic spells magic carpets magic rituals and so on is not acceptable,0,koszdi
if jesus had said you are the light of the world to atheists he would have been accurate i know people here understandably get chills down their spines when they hear the bible but consider this some of the things jesus said when applied to atheists are accurate for example his assertion you are the light of the world would have been far more accurately applied to atheists than to any of his followers unlike christianity or any other religion atheism is a force for freedom shining a light on the mental darkness of religious superstition if atheism is a light shining in the darkness then by extension atheists are also lights shining in the darkness we are the light of the world because we bring enlightenment and use it to drive religious superstition back into the slimy hole from whence it came we are the light of the world because we use facts logic and rational argument to free people from the shackles of faith if anything christians have it backwards they are the real children of darkness not atheists,0,kphja8

question about recent posts i have made about religion in other subs i have recently made posts in other forums about religion one of them was something in regards to the bible and one was in regards to a pastor of a church who got fired because his wife had an affair i found the up and down votes of the one about the bible very interesting after i made my comment to a comment in the thread my post started getting up and down votes i have to estimate there were thousands of up and down votes on my comment because the top post was at about and now it is at days later i kept checking the number of up vs down votes on my post throughout the next couple of days after i made it and the highest i ever saw if go was and the lowest was it is currently at zero is there any way to tell what the total of the number of votes was on my post i find it very fascinating that my comment that was negative towards the bible got an even number of up and down votes over what was likely thousands of votes if you find the post in my history please do not up or down vote me i am not making this post to gain karma strictly to point out that of thousands of votes agreed with me slamming the bible believers in regards to the comment i just made on a post where a pastor of a church got fired for his wife cheating on him i posted a long reply to him suggesting that now was a good time to take a close look at what he actually believes and what reality and facts in the digital age say to his beliefs again if you go look at my history please do not up or down vote my post i am not trying to gain karma and that one will probably get downvoted to hell if there really was such a place and so be it i am curious as to how it does turn out with up and down votes being that i really expected the one i made about the bible to get down voted to hell i am also curious as to what those in this group think about my comment to the op but i dont want to cross post a link to the op because it may be against the rules here or reddits rules and how my karma will be affected please advise or take this down if my entire post is out of line,0,kqtrai

since the exodus of the israelites from egypt is actually a cultural myth there is no basis for judaism or christianity i recently learned that there is no historical evidence of the exodus of gods chosen people led by moses from egypt most historical scholars agree it is a cultural myth which seems obvious to me now the book of exodus is extremely important to the formation of these religions it gives identity to the israelites and lays the grounds for god on earth and it is completely made up how can religious people justify their religion in light of this the implications of this seem infinite,0,kpej36

atheism isnt a deviation from the path its what comes after reaching the final cobblestone i grew up in a christian family and did my best to adhere but once i began using the critical thinking skills id employed to find success in all other aspects of my life and truly focused inward on my religious beliefs it became clear that the faith couldnt withstand simple scrutiny or basic levels of questioning and skepticism my father is still very much in the church and has repeatedly said that he prays for the day when ill find my way back onto the path but as ive told him repeatedly im not walking in some sinful parallel to a scripted righteous path im beyond it i followed it all the way to the end of its usefulness so any effort to find it again would mean going backwards and thats not the way life or paths work,0,kpz1uw
whats your favorite bit of insanity contradiction or hypocrisy from any religious text or belief system there are a lot of great examples of religious texts plainly stating something that should raise red flags for the followers of that system of faith ie mohammed riding a flying horse to heaven or the god of the bible being defenseless against civilizations with iron chariots or joseph smiths golden tablets that only he could translate or his claim that jesus visited america years or so before its discovery so many to choose from so id love to hear your favorite ones or the ones that stand out to you maybe even for some the one that started your own journey away from a god belief,0,krfc4v
media personalities and televangelists have employed what i would call a selfdefeating strategy i live in a fairly red state in the bible belt when scrolling through the frequency bands seeking talk news radio youre likely to run into multiple christian radio stations and personalities seeking to spread faith im not really one to dismiss a radio station purely based on its leanings im happy to hear what people have to say and build a more complete picture of how different parts of our society are viewing the same pieces of information in fact in terms of new music the local christian rock station is pretty great when you ignore all the lyrics so now to the point on my lengthy drive yesterday i listened to a bit of three different talk radio stations all christian and what i observed was media personalities definitively aligning their religious beliefs system with a specific political party and ideology one host even went as far as to say democrats policies are ungodly i should also disclaim at this point that i dont want to turn this into a political tangent and as an independent i have zero party loyalties that said they also listed some of these ungodly policy positions at a highlevel and they were climate change healthcare and sending people money to help them in the pandemic so according to this host what jesus would do is let the planet burn let people remain sick and suffering to the point of potential death and give anyone struggling financially as a result of a pandemic a big middle finger okay noted but this really got me thinking as it ties into a larger body of religious personalities pushing a rightwing agenda and accompanying talking points up to and including telling supporters to vote for trump and claiming that god told them trump would win a second term that implication though that anyone aligning with a democratic policy set is ungodly that really stood out to me statistically we know that there are a large number of christians who vote democrat so in a way these supposedauthoritative religious personalities are creating a wedge within their own system of faith which may be contributing to further radicalization and ultimately puritytesting existing members out of their own beliefs almost having the opposite effect of their stated goals rather than sharing their testimony and growing the followers base of their religion theyre weeding people out and whittling things down to a small sect of zealots not sure if there is a historical precedent or parallel to compare this to will need to do more thinking on that but either way this seems to be a selfdefeating strategy,0,krpl2k
my atheism agnosticism so i want to share in the hope i can understand myself and others like me better im all but an atheist i think technically im agnostic i believe that all organised human religions are false simply for the fact theyre human creations in a universe that is all but infinitely big every single religion or faith ive ever read about or come across just seems idiotic to me in comparison to scale of the universe we live in and our place in it as you can probably guess i have a keen interest in space and am even studying physics at university in the hopes of changing my career path that being said the reason i dont fully and truly feel im atheist is that when you start looking at the early universe and more specifically what caused it to spring into being the concept of god or a deity seems as good a reason as any for it coming into existence my gut says it wasnt a god and some natural facet but i have no proof either way so cant firmly say im atheist so to those who are atheist with what ive said in mind what causes you to feel so strongly that youre atheist that god or a godlike entity absolutely does not exist i tend to only accept things with proof as such the world i live in and the universe i know about strongly suggests there isnt a god but my lack of knowledge isnt enough to absolutely say there isnt one id love to know what other people think fee free to answer and throw your opinion my way one final thing is my selfdesignation as agnostic accurate or is atheist more appropriate because while i dont believe there is a god i also cant stand up and firmly state there definitely isnt one the closest i can come is that if there is a god it has absolutely nothing to with the human species that has evolved on this tiny little planet in the backend of a thoroughly average galaxy,0,kpppyi

the first mistake christians make the first mistake christians make is reading the bible in a passive state if you are the kind of person that reads the bible without asking questions like when was this written who wrote it is this a reliable historical account of history does this match up with science is the bible meant to be read as fact and not myth the fact is the bible is filled with mythical creatures mythical people mythical places like for example the book of revelation is filled with mythology but so is the old testament which includes unicorns dragons the nephilim horses of death etc ever since technology was invented bibical scholars and bibical historians has provided overwhelming evidence that the bibical stories were not written to be reliable historical accounts of history instead religious stories one great example to show how unreliable the bible is is the infamous and fraud book of isaiah many christians like to refer this book because it is filled with prophecies excerpts from encyclopedia general scholarly consensus through most of the century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of isaiah however there is not complete unanimity among biblical scholars with some still asserting that isaiah authored the entire book a typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors the composition history of isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient israel and in modern societies the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous while the authors are anonymous it is plausible that all of them were priests and the book may thus reflect concerns in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the deuteronomists until all the authors and dates for this book are verified you cannot refer prophecies because if these messianic prophecies are so important to the life of jesus and there are no verified authors and dates for theses messianic prophecies they can be easily changed after jesus even died these prophecies dont even matter because there is no historical proof that jesus fulfilled any of these messianic prophecies and another book that proves the idea of the bible being written as religious stories and not history is the whole entire book of exodus excerpt from encyclopedia the overwhelming consensus among scholars is that the story in the book of exodus is best understood as a myth and cannot be treated as history in any verifiable sense while archaeology has found traces left by even small bands of huntergatherers in the sinai there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the exodus story the conclusion that exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the bible seems irrefutable repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence instead modern archaeology suggests continuity between canaanite and israelite settlement indicating a primarily canaanite origin for israel while all but the most conservative scholars reject the biblical account of the exodus a majority still believes that the story conserves some historical basis though disagreeing widely about what that historical kernel might have been kenton sparks refers to it as mythologized history some scholars associated with the interpretative school of bibical minimalism show more skepticism towards ascribing any to the exodus with some arguing that the myth has its origins in the and postexilic jewish communities and has little or no roots in a real historical event science does not in any way support the bibles claims it is scientifically impossible to cramp every animal and insect species on one boat for days and forty nights without any death disease famine etc here are some contradictions for science in the bible followed along with some pretty in depth videos the genesis flood zoology disproves noahs flood how geology disproves noahs flood how paleontology disproves noahs flood how mythology disproves noahs flood how dendrochronology disproves noahs flood how meteorology disproves noahs flood how anthropology disproves noahs flood richard dawkins sinks noahs ark genesis creation narrative richard dawkins one fact to refute creationism the fact is evolution and the big bang disproves and science supports both in every way these two very big contradictions and it is sad to see that billion people around the world believe these two events happened and that statistic is unbelievably troubling not only to science but to the future of mankind itself either we as humans accept reality or fantasy as truth and ,0,kpbjkd

answers in genesis claims evolutionary scientists got the age wrong about dinosaurs how could such a popular website be so incredibly stupid and bias before i get into this i would like to say that this shows how religion has made people so ignorant especially creationists to think so many people follow this website is absurd and the story we have all heard from movies television newspapers and most magazines and textbooks is that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago according to evolutionists the dinosaurs ruled the earth for million years dying out about million years ago however scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages they only uncover dead dinosaurs ie their bones and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are the idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists story about the past no scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age in fact there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old no scientist observed dinosaurs die scientists only find the bones in the here and now and because many of them are evolutionists they try to fit the story of the dinosaurs into their view other scientists called creation scientists have a different idea about when dinosaurs lived they believe they can solve any of the supposed dinosaur mysteries and show how the evidence fits wonderfully with their ideas about the past beliefs that come from the bible excerpt from answers in genesis about when dinosaurs lived the story we have all heard from movies television newspapers and most magazines and textbooks is that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago probably because science supports it in every way and according to evolutionists the dinosaurs ruled the earth for million years dying out about million years ago however scientists do not dig up anything labeled with those ages they only uncover dead dinosaurs ie their bones and their bones do not have labels attached telling how old they are the idea of millions of years of evolution is just the evolutionists story about the past there is a thing called the scientific method and relative dating which evolutionary scientists used prove that every dinosaur lived before million years ago and then if you think that fossils are just going to appear with a sticky note from god saying the exact date of when the fossil lived than maybe you shouldnt be a scientists because actual scientists would get off their lazy ass and actually do the research no scientist was there to see the dinosaurs live through this supposed dinosaur age neither were you instead of using an outdated unreliable book to do their science they actually did the work in fact there is no proof whatsoever that the world and its fossil layers are millions of years old i know you have heard of the fossil record scientific theory radiocarbon dating relative dating absolute dating radiometric dating etc scientists only find the bones in the here and now and because many of them are evolutionists they try to fit the story of the dinosaurs into their view ironic that you are actually the one that is trying to fit dinosaurs into your view actually they used science which is something the bible knows very little about other scientists called creation scientists have a different idea about when dinosaurs lived they believe they can solve any of the supposed dinosaur mysteries and show how the evidence fits wonderfully with their ideas about the past beliefs that come from the bible source oh just your bible huh i could give many reasons why the bible knows nothing about basic science but i will only pick one god created light and darkness on the first day somehow god forgot to create the sun moon and stars only until day ,0,krc1xh

how do you expect to explain that to my kid thats a phrase that ive heard to much when it comes to evolution and natural selection sometimes it comes from new agnostic parents who actually want to educate their children about science and how the nature works my teacher told me for example about her five year old son who was curious about how the very first human was born she wanted to explain her son about the origin of species so she went to me because she knew that i have a special knowledge and interest in biology and ask me how to explain those complex themes for a little kid and i think thats awesome because usually when a parent or school teacher brings the question how i explain that to a kid it isnt with an open minded point of view the how i explain that to a kid is specially used as an excuse to not to teach evolution since kids cant understand it well i agree that the modern evolutionary theory is complicated and all but i have the strong belief that if you really understand something you can easily explain it to a kid and yes i think that if the teacher explains it correctly fully understand it and with simple words the evolution theory can be perfectly understood by children theyre not silly i trust in them theyre a lot of wonderful books to explain natural selection for the kids if you cant explain evolution to your kids then you clearly dont know what the theory talks about it isnt a surprise that most of the people that say how do you expect to explain that to my kid are fundamentalist catholics theyre the same that think children are a property some beings with malleable minds that will always listen to what their owners say these braindead people have a massive movement in my country supported by the church which is also against sex education because guess what it is too complicated and some religious thing or somewhat so basically if a child haves a question relating evolution we have to answer it and no religion even the parents one should intervene,0,kqoqds

if any god existed there would be only one religion he fact that the world is fractured into multiple religions means deities actually never spoke to the people of the world as they would then have a collective theological view this is especially true of the bible if the world was really cleansed so only a handful of christians survived as in the noahs ark story wouldnt there have been an eradication of all structures and wouldnt that have meant only christianity would survive as noah and his family would raise all offspring as believers yet there are still religions that exist that are much older not all religions are equally probable as in all religions that i know of humans are created with an understanding of the higher power that created them that would mean all the world sprung into one religion which would make the oldest religion the right one which i dare to point out is none of the abrahamic religions thank you goodbye also this would again mean wed all have a collective religion having been raised in the same faith and spoken to by our gods athiests some agnostics people who are religious but outside of the assumed right faith and other people such as satanists who preach against that prominent faith based on how almost all religions teach fear through punishment would be struck down or at higher risk of something terrible happening to them yet us heretical heathens are just as likely to experience miracles as in against all odds but it happened sometimes because sometimes luck does work in an individuals favor and tragedies as faithful believers of the assumed right faith so that is my take comment below and lets get a consultation page going for all the religious folk who frequent this page what are some logical asfollows reasons that it is unlikely any god exists also what are some evocative miracles you of the stout heathen class have experienced mine was when i was biking one day i was young probably or and i nearly died the road i lived on was unpaved and had these massive steep hills i ended up losing control of the bike on the biggest one and slid most of the way to the bottom on my side my brother carried me home and we didnt have a car so we had to wait while my mother ran along the road to each of our distant neighbors and knocked until one was home and answered she was a nurse and gave my mother instructions on how to stop my bleeding while driving me to the hospital it turned out that the wound went so deep a bit of artery was exposed somehow though it wasnt damaged if the wound had gone any deeper i would have bled out and considering the time it took to staunch the bleeding of my wound it was surprising it hadnt anyways,0,kpka1h

simplified rebuttal and reasoning for why this is wrong the following is an example i saw of this argument in full on rmuslimlounge what can explain the existence of the universe and ultimately our own existence possible answers the universe is eternal or infinite the universe created itself or came out of nothing the universe was created by a dependent existence the universe is a product of a multiverse the universe was created by an independent existence rationalizing each answer is the universe eternal or infinite time and space seem to be a reality of our universe the universe is also measurable and contains measurable objects therefore if the universe is bound by these finite limitations it is not possible for the universe to be eternal or infinite the universe is composed of finite things if we make a sum of all finite things in the universe we will always reach a finite value because everything in the universe is finite therefore the universe is finite if time exists there must have been a beginning to the universe the redshift observation this is an observation made by astronomers which lends credence towards the expansion of the universe if the universe is expanding with the passage of time then going back in time would show that the universe had a beginning from which is derived the theory of the big bang nevertheless the expansion of the universe alone exemplifies its limitation infinite cannot exist in our known reality which is the universe because it is composed of limited things also infinity is a concept additionally the universe is dependent as we do not have any evidence of something within this universe that does not require something else to exist ie selfsubsisting as this would violate certain laws of the universe everything in the observable universe is dependent on something else the universe is always changing either its expanding or it has within it stars dying or stars forming nebulas forming planets forming and blackholes forming and so on this again lends credence to the fact that the universe is limited we find a lot of change that occurs in the universe the universe is dependent changing finite and limited the universe created itself or it came out of nothing from the laws of nature and human observation it is impossible for something to create itself it is also impossible for something to come out of nothing this is because it would go against the fundamental laws such as the first law of thermodynamics newtons third law and laws of causality the universe is created from something dependentfinite if what created the universe was dependent then that means it also needs a cause this leads to the paradox of infinite regression in other words the dependent being must have been created by another dependent being who must have been created by another dependent being and so on in an infinite series of casual reactions however from the infinite regression cause and effect are not possible as the cause would infinitely regress and thus prevent the effect from ever occurring in other words the universe would never be created by the dependent being an example of the impossibility of infinite regression if someone a wanted to jump they require permission from someone else b b requires permission from someone else c to give permission for a to jump this chain infinitely regresses backwards therefore a will never be able to jump because he will never be able to receive permission to jump due to the infinite regression of permission as such an infinite regression can never lead to an effect and the universe would not exist another example is that of dominos if there are infinite dominos then the last domino will never fall ie the effect will never happen due to infinite regression the existence of the universe cannot be ultimately explained by a dependent being the universe is a product of a multiverse a possibility that is theorized by some scientists although with no substantial evidence this answer to the beginning of the universe is another way of looking at the proposed answer which states a dependent being had caused the universe to exist this answer does not solve the problem of infinite regression and only raises the question where did the multiverse come from because the multiverse is also something with limitationsis finite thus does not truly answer our question the universe was created by an independentinfinite existence this cause would solve the paradox of infinite regression from happening because this being would be independent and infinite and therefore the first cause of existence in other words this being would not be created by anything else nor would this being ever have an ending this being would not be dependent on the universe but the universe would be dependent on it therefore this being would be independent of our universe and the being would not be measurable unlike the universe from philosophical reasoning it is possible to assume an independent being caused the universe for example the contingency argument claims that all things in nature depend on something else for their existence ie are contingent and that the whole cosmos must therefore itself depend on a being which exists independently or necessarily or else we face the problem of infinite regression if this being never existed the universe would never exist since the universe is composed of dependent parts it is therefore entirely dependent therefore an independent infinite existence must exist for the dependent existence to exist or else we would face the problem of infinite regression an infinite being must exist to explain dependent beings observed in our universe conclusion for question an independent being is the most likely rational possibility for the existence of our universe it is necessary for there to be an independent infinite being for the universe to exist to prevent infinite regression of dependency and causality some qualities of this being can be deduced from reasoning for example this being must be independent or selfsubsisting to prevent the paradox of infinite regression must be infinitely knowledgeable because it created the laws that govern our universe must be infinitely powerful because it created the universe must be unimaginable and unquantifiable to the human mind or else it would be finite and must be unchanging as it is infinite,0,kq92dd

forced to go to church im in high school and recently my mom decided that she would get our family back into going to church i havent yet told her that im an atheist and i really dont want to waste my time at church is there anything i can say to make her let me stay home without her thinking im an atheist she has already told me that i will have to be accountable to god for not going to church even though i already fucking go to a private christian school days a week,0,kr974i
why is it a joke for atheists to pray im not sure why this is on my mind recently but ive noticed in a lot of pop culture like memes and tv shows its always a joke that atheists are secretly praying like for example i walked past the tv the other day and family guy was playing i was bored so i thought id sit down and watch a little basically it was the episode where brain and stewie get locked in a bank vault and stewie sees brain praying and starts mocking him saying stuff like what are you doing i thought you were an atheist even in other places ive seen this same trope used over and over again when a non religious character is close to death theyll frantically start praying and the joke against them is that they dont want to put in the time to have a relationship with god but will crawl back and ask for help when theyre in danger basically i get the idea that writers are building these people with the attitude i wouldnt dare be stupid enough to believe something as crazy as religion but give them a character development when they have a near death experience where they realize their flaws and become sympathetic to christianity kinda like in scary movies theres always the one character that doubts the existence of a monster and mocks everyone else for believing in it but as soon as they see it with their own eyes begs everyone else to protect them like atheists supposedly crawling back to god when the fear of death is placed in front of them while i havent had a near death experience per say i have been a child with an overreactive brain and the fear of hell taught to me when i got stuck on a roller coaster was in a minor fender bender an many other pretty harmless but terrifying encounters for a kid id always silently clasp my hands together and cry to god how sorry i was for doubting him and that i would never speak his name in vain again so long as i wasnt sent to hell because my church had taught me that even if you dont follow god during your life the only way you would make it into heaven was to beg for forgiveness on your death bed but i never once prayed when i or someone else needed help it wasnt that i was attempting to take advantage of the situation and get a miracle i was just petrified of being stuck in an eternity of suffering and i still am i feel more secure in myself now that im older seeing that one of the biggest reasons people leave religion altogether was because they didnt want to feel forced into believing something through fear but if im being honest if someone were to hold a gun to my head right now id still probably pray not because i want to be saved from the death of a bullet through my skull but cause theres still a part of me thats petrified of hell its like a dark room you know theres no monster and if you turn on the light itll be empty but your anxious cause its the unknown mixed with your imagination trying to scare u but that doesnt stop you from being afraid im and i still run up the basement stairs i just wish it were different cause i feel like im selling myself short and im taking my own atheism for granted ik theres no god no heaven and no hell but it still doesnt stop me from worrying,0,kqj6us
i dont get the argument religion gave me a reason for life even if i could look at this from christian perspective for example i still dont see how religion would give me a reason for life with the way the bible is written it doesnt tell you what passion to follow or even how to find your own passion in life it doesnt tell you what sort of person you should be in life or even the fact there is almost nothing to find about life in the bible its only about the rules that you need to follow created by god to be rewarded with eternal life or in short live to die which is the total opposite of what these people are saying,0,kq3bpi

what made you become an athiest hey all im sure this question is probably asked here a lot but im curious im an year old trans woman id say that alone confirms im an athiest lol but what made you become an athiest for me personally it was due to the fact that i thought god was mocking me i was around at the time and every time i prayed to god something bad would happen immediately after i remember praying that my parents would stop fighting and love each other again only for one of my parents to pull a gun on the other i also remember praying to make my dad less angry and a better person to stop taking his anger out on me immediately after he came in my room and screamed at me to tears over something trivial i just gave up another thing i know this will sound edgy but i just refuse to have my life dictated by someone else its my life my rules my story i refuse to let some phony old man up in the clouds decide everything i do for all eternity you know how we see greek mythology as just entertaining or to teach lessons why cant we see all religion that way we know greek mythology isnt true its just fun stories so why cant all religion be on the same page alright rant over i look forward to your responses,0,kr0a6r

discussion the two problems with atheism lack of community misconceptions about what it means im an atheist which i define simply as someone who doesnt believe in a deity i do believe in spiritual energy and the power of human connection which is probably the limit of many many selfprofessed christians if there were a church or gathering place for atheists to find a consistent sense of community and collectively focus on building a spiritual community id be all in now i know people will say try x church or you can get that from a yoga studio or meditation group of whatever but what i am suggesting is that there needs to be a consolidated movement of atheists building churches preferably all in one brand whatever that may be and spreading the word through action and community about the power of atheist spirituality i think the humanists are on the right path but there really needs to be a physical infrastructure to support the messaging id even suggest the same architecture mormons were successful at this all mormon churches look basically the same something like a quaker meeting house simple small and open christianity has essentially become a corrupt fascist political movement and unless people are offered an alternative i think their attempts to coopt what it means to be good are going to succeed once and for all ive been thinking about this a lot over the past few years and wonder if something like this could gain traction id love to hear peoples thoughts,0,kqzyuu

why miracles are a crock this is something i wrote several years ago it popped up in my fb feed today and i thought id share it here ive been listening to a story about a woman who donated bone marrow the recipient was a man who was struggling with his religious faith the call to get the marrow came three days after his birthday so he decided that all of this was evidence of god the three days after his birthday he took to be similar to the three days before christ was said to have risen from the tomb to me all of this is evidence of the massive intellectual dishonesty of this brand of christianity because when they talk about million to one odds they claim the one but dismiss the million if something happens against terrible odds it means that this same god lets almost everyone else die apparently twenty people die every day waiting for a bone marrow transplant the real hero of course was the donor who is an atheist but who nevertheless went onstage many times with the recipient who was a stage magician to talk about this miracle simply because they had a sign up process for the bone marrow transplant organization and after hearing the story and praising the irrelevant jesus people would sign up to donate theres your miracle,0,kqmp23
i was an atheist before but now a believer hi please read this and give me a chance to explain so islam is similar to christianity except it has been found the bibles text has been changed so many times but the holy quran remains an unchanged religious text and it has been proven to be the unchanged word of godallah quran do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were once one mass then we split them apart we created from water every living thing will they not then believe this is talking about the big bang theory that started the whole universe when everything split apart and created the universe we knowalso ask yourself where did the energy that created this whole universe come from it didnt come from nothing so it came from god this was said years ago before science discovered it proving that the quran is the word of god now stay with me there is more for you comrade quran we built the universe with great might and we are certainly expanding it greatttt this is talking about the universe constantly expanding which we found also years later a man called muhammad pbuh our prophet couldnt have known this because he couldnt read or write was in a vast desert and this was years ago where no one knew of the universe as this information is too astronomically advanced for their knowledge then quran and indeed we created an extract of claythen placed each human as a sperm a secure placethen we developed the drop into a clinging clot of blood then developed the clot into a lump of flesh then developed the lump into bones then clothed the bones with flesh then we brought it into being as a new creation blessed is allah the best of creators now you should watch this miracle on youtube because the arabic words had more meaning for this process like it talks about the human embryo at a certain stage looking like the head of a leech which it did exactly look like the head of the leech it cant be seen with the human eye when in the womb so how is it so perfectly predicted how could someone now years ago what a microscopic thing looked like because allah exists my brothersister you can go on and learn islam and read the quran ignore what the media says about us because the reality is beautiful ,0,kql5to

unlike a lot of terrible personal stories here science got me to leave religion i notice a lot of people on this sub struggled with religion because of their past experiences with the church im sorry to hear that fortunately i was lucky enough to have parents that eventually accept my view on religion my reason for leaving religion was rather scientific when i was around years old i started watching videos and documentaries about science i was especially interested in space physics and evolution the amount of evidence an idea required to be taken as a fact was interesting to me the theory of evolution for example is supported by so many different individual fields of studies massive amount of evidence was explaining a phenomenon that was extremely frowned upon by the church i noticed nobody in my church i spoke to was even remotely interested in such things this was a big eye opener for me to be educated in these sort of things you would need to be motivated to learn about it everyone thought that evolution and the big bang are the same things fun thing everyone asked why i believed in the fact that the universe exploded into each other in a few seconds i responded i am not the one who believes that it is you who believes that the universe could be created instantly this whole experience also got me to see that you will believe in the religion you were raised into its just the perceptive mind of a child that they abuse for their doctrines we either find out the hard way that religion is just a man made way of poorly explaining things or we finds some other way for me being science something that humbles me is the vast size of the universe and objects inside it check out this site if you would like to see it for yourself,0,kow5r0

i dont understand why so many people believe in karma if there was really some supernatural force that ensures that good people get rewarded and bad people get punished then everyone would only be doing good things but then why do some murder cases go unsolved for many years like zodiac killer why do people like jim morrison and heath ledger die young and in pain in spite of being good guys why did lawrence bittaker and charles manson live a very long life in spite of being serial killers i find the belief in karma stupid the universe doesnt care if somebody does good or bad and it doesnt rewardpunish individuals when a young girl gets kidnapped raped and beaten to death the world doesnt stop say this is not how the story is supposed to be and bring her back to life while making the killer die in car accident it doesnt care it reminds me of vince gilligan from breaking bad saying that he believes in karma and that assholes get their day in court sure maybe in breaking bad bad guys get killed off but it is nothing more than wishfullfillment many bad guys live a long and happy life and many good guys die young and suffer also there seems to exist a double standard among west it is ok to not believe in god but there is nothing wrong in believing in karma can somebody explain this to me,0,kou4ws

the concept of religion seems bizarre to me growing up in a christian household ive always thought of religion like i do santa claus or the easter bunny a nice way to bring parents closer to their kids but not real of course the joy brought by these traditions is real but not the concept itself as a result i grew up almost chocked realizing that so many people actually believe in these magical stories in the bible as i thought of it as yet another lie we tell our kids to bring them joy furthermore i dont understand why people choose to believe in magical stories rather than proved scientific facts and progress like vaccines and such anyway i hope that people can help me understand,0,kpc81a

thinking about taking up religion or at least going to church this is something thats been on my mind for quite some time now and i wanted to know if any other atheistagnostic person has considered this or has done this my reason for considering this ive spent the majority of my life depressed and i think a large part of it was the result of me concluding that there was no god or anything magical about the world i feel like taking up religion could perhaps help me somewhat mentally i think by providing some structure for me to hold on to as i live life i feel like this might not be the best solution but i dont think accepting or coming to terms with the idea of something more to life is possible for me at least right now,0,kr8k4i

need to rant so my husband and i are atheists i kind of prefer the term secular humanist but theres not a big community there my parents are also nonbelievers and we are very close with them whereas his parents are religious though in different degrees his mom believes in god i suppose but doesnt go to church often however his father has always gone to church on sundays insisted on giving a blessing at his sisters otherwise nonreligious wedding but otherwise has seemed pretty quiet about it however he seems to have gotten more sucked in over the years recently my husband had covid despite hardly going anywhere and taking all the precautions when we found out it was covid we were both so frustrated and upset that he somehow got it and that was on top of him feeling miserable and us having to isolate from each other his mom called me the night we found out and was so confused about why he sounded so sad when she talked to him i explained that he was rightly angry at the situation and scared and we had both needed to process it because it seemed so impossible anyway that was a couple weeks ago and luckily my husband is feeling a ton better today was his birthday and it started with a text from his dad that said happy birthday and then went on to say he was distressed by the anxiety he heard in my husbands voice when they talked the day we found out he got covid and that it doesnt have to be that way if we find a church and learn to accept god what the actual fuck all i learned from that text is that whenif we have kids he is never allowed to be alone with them,0,kq1i47
my story of leaving religion feel free to share yours i was quite religious growing up church every sunday sundayschool mission trips to reservations in the dakotas and everything i was brought up as a protestant whole bunch wasps so you have to confirm your belief in jesus and all that a bit of the ways through high school this is called confirmation and requires a bunch of weekly classes and chats about what your faith means to you and how important god is to you and culminates with you standing in front of the congregation and announcing to everyone that you have accepted god into your life and will be an official member of the church onto the story about halfway through my confirmation process my brother came out and oddly at the same time the church was going through the process of becoming an official open and affirming church which basically means that they are cool with people who are lgbt and all that jazz i talked to a majority of the church advocating for the church to accept my brother back to the congregation since he took a step back right before coming out a month before confirmation was the churchwide vote and they voted to not become open and affirming i talked to my parents my mother was more religious than my father he apparently accepts that there is a god but doesnt think jesus is anything special she is very into it personally but luckily she accepts that her children are not and basically told them that if the church was going to deny my brother then it wasnt a group of people i wanted to be involved with the church asked if i still wanted to give a speech about rejecting my confirmation and i did so i wrote a speech where i explained how hurt and ashamed of them i was and then i gave my speech at my last sunday i never understood how people who we grew up with for years could look at my brother who had been exactly as involved as i had been was all of a sudden persona non grata i just wanted to get this off my chest and out there and i know there are going to be at least some of you all who this resonates with my family means more to me than anything and i couldnt believe that whatever god the church was following would allow such abandonment,0,kp9zg6

what do atheists think of the notion of freedom from psychological suffering as taught by the buddha in buddhism and other religions hinduism taoism theres this notion that its possible to be free from psychological suffering in this lifetime the various spiritualreligious traditions offer frameworks for this pursuit some of which offer clear steps to curing an individual of anxiety depression and entering into an existence of lasting peace and contentment im wondering what your individual thoughts are on this so i have a few questions do you think its possible to be free of psychological suffering in this lifetime if you dont think its possible is there anything that could convince you that it is possible this third one may not be relevant to everyone but popular among atheists is the notion that free will is an illusion so if you dont believe that we have free will why do you still identify with your actions even though that seems to be partly what causes suffering i know sam harris has popularized this idea lately of spirituality without religion and i personally think theres something to it as well but i cant say for sure what it is and id like to get your thoughts on it thanks for your time,0,kpc9vh

why the church endorsed the stoic writings of epictetus ive found a great deal of strength wisdom and happiness in stoicism so when pewdiepie yes yes i know i know youre way too cool to watch pewdiepie were all very impressed recently suggested discourses and selected writings by epictetus i figured why not give it a shot dudes a legend epictetus not pewds well in the introduction they mention that these writings were among the few rare ones approved for reading in the early church thought that was very progressive of them but he makes a lot of casual references to zeus and separately to god now i get that hes putting his arguments into context for his audience and when youre exploring existentialism you cant avoid including these things in the conversation but as it progresses whats distressing is that he really does seem to have this idea that the universe is a designed thing and that all things have a designed purpose big swathes of text are chewed up with arguments that there must be a god its pretty disappointing now im not saying its not worth reading in fact its kind of awesome the discourses are a rough transcription of his lectures and it feels really alive as he casually makes jokes talks about going to the gym current events etc and it really is a nice examination of both reason and virtue separate from any notion of a divine creator but then it flips into this whole color exists and we have organs to perceive it thus god silliness i sometimes forget how intellect can lock a person just as securely into an incorrect conclusion as it can a correct one,0,kpczlt

why do religious people let god get away with being so horrible i found this place and hoping this post would be appropriate here looking through the rules it looks like it at least but i had to get all of this off my chest after hearing yet another christian talking about hell and punishment in the afterlife for non christians and the amount of times ive heard that with no one else stepping up and confronting them about it i just had to tell this to someone and ask this question i seriously dont understand how people worship a god that gives no proof of his existence as well as letting millions suffer undeservedly daily and constantly all over the world and punishes those who dont worship him only after giving them proof of his existence that being the afterlife that is not a god worth worshipping thats a dictator controlling others via fear under the illusion of love and unharmful spirituality and other shit that actually is worth anyones attention according to these people andor the bible if that person i saw bringing this up last time claiming to be an expert is to be believed you can be a good person who makes the world a better place but you havent accepted god into your life or whatever so youre going to get punished that is also not mentioning all the horrible shit god lets happendirectly causes to happen himself in the bible at least from what ive read how is believing in and worshipping such a deity considered acceptable let alone so commonplace is beyond me i do not believe god exists or at least i dont think i do whether its genuine or my brain protecting itself from the thoughts of something so horrible being so powerful but it boggles my mind that my feelings towards this are considered controversial and that that if i were to state them in public where i live or most other places id be shamed at best and violently attacked at worst if you believe for example dictators ruling over countries punishing people for even saying the littlest things against them is wrong and should have consequences like most people do why the double standard why do religious people let god get away with being so horrible,0,krjtok
correlation between q anon and christianity ive been reading a bunch of articles about how successfully q anon has infiltrated christian circles come to think of it i havent come across a single nonevangelical person in my life who has fallen for the conspiracy of conspiracies anyway i found this article from australia broadcasting corporation to be particularly interesting as churches prove fertile ground for conspiracy theories some pastors are taking a stand some highlights its a very parallel structure a group of people that are in on a secret plan which is very good and the secret plan will save you in troubling times the belief framework is that god has a plan we dont know the plan god will unfold the plan and the chosen will be chosen,0,kp2v5k
i hate religion because it holds back science pretty much as the title says i hate religion because it holds back science if youve never heard of the golden age of islam it pretty much went like this the entire place was booming in regards to science and so many things were being discovered and then this absolute fucker comes along and says that god has declared it evil and they all bloody stopped because they did not want to displease god of course this wasnt the only reason but it was a big one anther example is cloning if youre over the age of twenty you probably remember the giant protests that came out due to it going against nature or stop trying to play god and guess who it came from im sure you can guess its fucking christianity which surprised absolutely noone and this was because cloning had very high failure rates at the time which is of course is understandable due to it being a new science and it was shut down because that stupid fucking religion declared it inhumane and therefore got it shutdown now think about this we probably could have significantly lowered those rates by now and this field of science could help in numerous ways for the medical field im only going to list off one reason but the most significant one is cloning organs and this would allow us to save more lives by lowering down the time on the waiting list but we cant because of religion,0,kozwm9

i challange christians to answer this a question why do we take pleasure from doing some stuff eating reproducing etc and feel pain by doing some stuff hitting yourself etc religion umm because god did that way evolution nerval system pleasure and pain evolved in a way that it would be in favor of the creature as you know in evolution theory two things are important for evolution survival and reproduction survival is basicly eating pleasure and escaping dangers like your body alarming you by sending you pain signals as you see things that give us pleasure actually are the way they are because they have an important role in evolution not just a random gift of god evolution has a perfect answer for this though no religious text can answer this,0,koylro

when the church forbade love there are many examples of government and religion throughout history being related or in the worst cases being one and the same notably we had the catholic church in spain for a long time the catholic church in austria and in the modern day we have islam in saudi arabia which holds the quran in its constitution generally islam in the middle east judaism in israel but also an example such as the church of england in the united kingdom now generally in this day and age the anglican presence in the united kingdom is becoming more of a cultural symbol rather than an actual denomination as a christian denomination the church of england is declining which im personally thankful for there was once a historic time not so long ago when the teachings of the anglican church caused a british constitutional crisis in january king george v died after a reign of almost years which by british standards is pathetic however he was succeeded by his son who ascended the throne as king edward viii im sure some of you have heard this story before king edward falls in love with the american divorce wallis simpson and the church and the parliament forbids them to marry edward was faced with either leaving simpson marrying her and thereby causing a crisis in the country or abdicate the king chose to abdicate in december ultimately and was succeeded by his brother who became king george vi while there were multiple reasons why edward who was later made the duke of windsor by his brother couldnt have married simpson as king the primary reasons were that the british people didnt want an american on the throne and the church of england taught that people couldnt remarry while their former spouse was still alive the latter being the dominant reason as back then the majority of the british people still took the church of england religiously seriously simpsons exhusband was still alive and died in edward duke of windsor died in and wallis simpson died in ,0,kqp9el

according to the bible christians are supposed to love satan at matt jesus said you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be children of your father in heaven jesus says christians are to love their enemies satan is their enemy so according to jesus they are to love satan if jesus is god it is gods will that christians love satan if god is love john then god loves satan too christians have no real excuse to not love satan nowhere in the bible does it say satan is beyond redemption satan can always repent of his sins and be saved assuming everyone has free will some passages imply universal salvation ie rom col so eventually even satan will be saved maybe christians should start hanging out with satanists more often and actually like get to know satan,0,kqimxk

its funny but in my opinion athiests have a better chance of enlightenment than the religious its because they arent led astray from looking at existence without some preconceived idea about it as long as they dont take science too religiously as having the answers past its wiggly energy that is interchangeable into matter they dont believe in others stories but that doesnt mean they dont revel in what an oddity it is to exist they keep their eyes open if theyre seeking and eventually they will see the perfection that this whole experience is,0,kpd9z7

i finally told my parents im an atheist hey everyone this is my first time posting on reddit and i just need to empty my thoughts i come from a pentecostal indian family and ive gone to church just about every sunday since i was born during my childhood i was really religious and prayed every night i was a bit of a model child for the church as i played piano for our worship services however when i was a teenager i developed a religious ocd that caused me to constantly obsess doubt and feel guilty about having intrusive doubtful thoughts about religion i often avoided any sort of topic that would cause me to doubt my christianity for example learning about evolution in school caused me a great deal of distress and when i would go home i would attempt to quench my fears by looking at christian websites that talked about the flaws of evolution of course at the time i didnt realize that i was dealing with ocd eventually this particular form of ocd dissipated only for it to turn into another obsession i wont go into it here around the same time i developed a more liberal perspective of christianity where i didnt take the supernatural aspects of the bible literally i maintained this belief until as i went to college but i still struggled heavily with ocd it was the beginning of my sophomore year in college when i realized that i had ocd and suddenly everything had made sense i suddenly realized how ridiculous it would be for god to give me such a condition one that had caused my mind to doubt him in a way that was completely out of my control and this along with all of the logical inconsistencies in the bible caused me to think i was an atheist at first it was certainly hard to accept never seeing your deceased relatives again is a hard thing to accept but i am much more comfortable now in the ephemeralness of life there was no way i could tell my parents immediately considering how religious they were that was about two years ago im now entering my last semester of college and i am fortunate to have a job where i can support myself if needed i told my brother just a few months ago and thankfully he was very understanding and supportive ive been dating someone whos not christian for about two years now and she also has completely supported me and im also thankful for that my parents dont know that as it seems the most important thing in the world for them is for me to date a christian girl and theyve been trying to set me up with christian indian girl from another state for about a month or so i knew when this started happening i had to tell them soon my dad asked me today why i havent texted her yet and i told him that i was an atheist i knew it was going to break his heart and we ended up debating for over a couple hours hes so upset by the fact that i dont want to marry a christian girl because itll keep the peace in our family very selfish of him if you ask me at one point he said hed cut me out if i wouldnt marry a christian girl but later retracted the statement probably realizing what a bad father that would make him my mom was coming home soon and that was what i was really afraid of shes as traditional as could be and very emotional when she came home we told her and she seemed extremely depressed and disappointed and it was really difficult to see her like that im feeling quite depressed right now but i know that i did the right thing and that this too shall pass any positive comments support or stories would be greatly appreciated,0,kqndn3

intelligent design advocate misquoteds rationalwiki well rationalwikithe rationalists answer to wikipedia i guess has sniffed out human exceptionalism and irrationally label it creationism thats pretty surprising to me as i have repeatedly stated i believe he is true whether we evolved from random processes were designed through intelligent thought or were createdor all of the above besides i am in a bit of trouble among some human exceptionalists because i dont argue from religion for that interesting debate see the human life reviews symposium on human exceptionalism oh well when some people dont really want to address that with which they disagree they scream the creationists are coming the creationists are coming i guess its a way of trying to disguise their own twodimensional thought processes except they said the most recent usage of the phrase itself can be found in discovery institute propaganda like intelligent design their use of the phrase basically amounts to creationism specifically baraminology in a funny hat the idea is that humans are unlike any other life form on earth and never mind the repeated parallels biologists find with other animals and the successful predictions they make based on that model precisely as if humans were just another evolved life form that we had a pretty good idea where it fit in the tree of life the fact you invoke an intelligent creator shows this to be dishonest and ignores your conspiracy mongering that they point out saying its not creationism is a nonsequitor,0,kqlfu5

the little church down the road so just wanted to share this for others who might be a little more open minded i see so many churches going against orders and holding services and it infuriates me now im hardcore atheist however im one who respects any and all religions what other people do in their minds and in their hearts is their business anyways every sunday for the past months at least ive passed the church down the road from my house and not once have the held a normal service i love it i pass by and the preacher is standing at the top of the stairs with a mic and speaker system and everyone is sitting in their cars listening honestly mad respect to all of them considering im in a very christian state in the south i honestly applaud them for doing the right thing i may not agree with anything in that book but i can agree with human decency keep it up little church keep it up,0,kr2pnn
what makes us human people say language sense of self range of emotion etc that might sound correct but you have to remember that we were raised by humans as has most of humanity but then you get these crazy things were kids are raised by wolves and dogs they dont act like humans but like dogs so it makes you wonder what does it mean to be human are humans actually social animals or do we just think that because our whole society is social was language just an invention and not part of evolution let me know what you think,0,kopo69

usa what is the laymans explanation of the separation of church and state is this technically a law or is it just a different way of saying the government cannot officially take a religious position and turn into a theocracy am i correct in assuming the following if the government forces all churches close because of covid but not mosques or other temples they violated the law because they oppressed just one religion if the government forces all places of worship to close because of covid its legal because they are treating all religions equally i just read a news story in ohio saying that a religious private school won a case against the state government because the shutdown violated their religious freedoms when secular placed like grocery stores were allowed to stay open i know thats an absolute bull reason but apparently it worked for them maybe im completely wrong in my understanding,0,kpfija

cognitive dissonance i have a friend with whom i am discussing the bible she tried to convince me the bible is true and i sent her a number of messages including the emperors new clothes she thinks if i speak to a pastor or a doctor in theology they will be able to explain why the bible is objectively true however had they such knowledge wouldnt pastors be preaching it in their churches wouldnt that be their basis for trying to convince nonbelievers that the bible is true its sad how christians put up with cognitive dissonance sweep it under the carpet as it were because thinking for ones self when it contradicts the apparent word of god becomes an idol and is therefore to be avoided at all costs,0,kpjwja
how many religions have punishments for nonbelievers either adherents of different religions or atheists in their versions of the afterlife im wondering this because even with pascals wager it doesnt mean either christianity is correct or atheism is correct it means either atheists are correct or many other religions esp one with punishments in the afterlife since thats what the wagers about are possibly correct so even if one ends up taking it they might just end up in some other religions hell,0,kptboe

the more research and experience i have in life the more i think the free will argument for problem of evil is bullshit you have to freely love god love isnt exactly a choice many children are groomed to love their abusers does that make it a choice then i certainly hope you dont think it is also with the evidence of many disorders such as neurological ones there is support for the idea that we arent entirely in control of our own thoughts desires and actions sleepwalkers didnt have the free will to sleep walk people with alzheimers didnt have the free will to forget if anyone knows phinease gage for example he was described as a quiet and gentle man but after an accident he was describe as mean for lack of better words did he choose to be mean and hateful i doubt it the fact is our physical body that can be effected by outside forces entirely out of our control can change our thoughts however if we were to assume that phinease gage really did have free will his ability to freely sin could very well be limited to self harm only as opposed to murder the fact is with murder god is overriding the victims will to live in favour of allowing the murderer to murder i cant say i know exactly how much free will we have but i do know that if a god existed supporting consequences of free will instead of preventing some of the most abhorrent tragedies just shows god to be a massive dick hitler can choose to exercise his free will by trying to kill jews doesnt mean he has to succeed,0,ks0fqz

sikhnet one of the largest and most influential sikhism websites shamelessly lies about how their gurus knew and spoke about waveparticle duality why do religious people do this literally just lying and making things up out of thin air just to make it seem like their religion has all the answers when they clearly are just a product of ignorance and superstition so the sikhnet article has two parts on this specific topic first they provide a very long scientific explanation about wave particle duality and then they talk about how their gurus knew about this before the scientists did wow and they also conflate the meaning of this theory to the existence and nature of god so the first part of the article is very long and filled with scientific jargon so i will only include a small snippet of it waveparticle duality postulates that all particles in the universe exhibit properties of both wave and particle this is a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics standard interpretations of quantum mechanics explain this paradox as a fundamental property of the universe while alternative interpretations explain the duality as an emergent secondorder consequence of various limitations of the observer then it talks about how their gurus knew and affirmed this incredibly ground breaking theory through their teachings about the nature of god and they literally use fake quotes that they just made up and said that their gurus said it hundreds of years before scientists figured it out so the article continues by saying sri guru granth sahib the supreme sikh scripture had already held the theory of waveparticle duality in and century and recorded in the hymns of guru nanak guru amardass guru ramdass and guru arjan the development of this theory in science and the theory already explained in sri guru granth sahib are discussed here the scientists were able to have vague idea of waveparticle duality in century but were able to experiment in century guru arjan however described in century that all the particles are in the wave forms referring to the creation of the universe he said whatever is subtle in waves is also solid in particles in fact the gurus described the entire god and his creation is both subtle waves and particle solid god have created the universe out of light where he was first in wave form subtle and later turned into the particle solid form he became manifest from unmanifest he changed the from subtle wave form through the word into body solid forms remained subtle but expanded himself into solid bodies he is now prevalent everywhere in the form of both subtle wave and solid particles the entire beings meditate in his remembrance in the form of both particle manifest and wave unmanifest so this is laughably fake guru arjan never said anything like that he did not say whatever is subtle in waves is also solid in particles they just made that up what theyre essentially dping is taking two words from the guru granth sukham meaning subtle or small or unmanifest and asthul meaning manifest and ascribing them to mean wave and particle respectively even though those words do not have the same meaning whatsoever if you cross check the refrences or citations they provided like for youll see that in the guru granth sahib page line the guru wasnt even talking about god in that line or in the preceding lines he was talking about a hindu devotee to vishnu the line which sikhnet provides as a reference says about a hindu devotee in the unmanifest he sees the manifest world to exist so how is this evidence that their guru knew about wave particle duality and where does it say whatever is solid in waves is also solid in particles for the reference linked to guru granth sahib page line it says o nanak he is the subtle and he is the manifest which according to sikhnet subtle in this verse meant god and his creation exists in a wave form and manifest meaning that he exists in particle form the guru granth sahib says about god from the small and subtle you become big and manifest which according to sikhnet means that god created the universe by going from the wave version of light to the particle form which im pretty sure is absolutely incorrect in describing the cause of the big bang let alone the wave particle duality theory the guru granth sahib says but to the subtle image of the immaculate name they apply the form of a body what he was talking about here was that hindus call god the unseen lord yet they depict god in the form of human bodies he was talking about the contradictions of hindu priests not particles and waves the ggs says he himself is seen to be subtle and he himself is obvious the ggs says all beings both subtle and gross meditate in remembrance and the original claim that they made that every being remembers god in wave and particle form is so bizzare like what does that even mean and the comments on this article are all praising it as eye opening and full of knowledge this is a site that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and they give completely incorrect information that would take anyone just a few minutes to prove wrong,0,ko3tvm

an americans argument for keeping church and state separate any political party that bases its entire vision on exploiting a specific way of worshipping the whitewashed caricature of a jewish socialist avatar of an unproven supreme being has no business making decisions for everyone any party that worships the tangerinetinted abomination of that jesuscaricature is fucking mental how about instead we pay attention to whats happening to the actual people and how many are still being raptured to heaven unnecessarily or the ones that will face crippling medical debt because some swamp rat licker didnt want to wear a mask to the store for the part time covidiots if youre gonna wear a mask wear the fucking mask dont leave your nose hanging out either tuck your facedick back in or lose the whole damn mask dont do things in halfmeasures or the people that lost their jobs and cant afford food while moscow mitch does whatever the fuck hes doing if youre part of the the republican party has burned you severely in the past days the republican party that up until election day was in lockstep with trump he has lost the party is a serpent eating its own tail and people still hang on the words of their god king these people are borderline lost causes they refuse to accept reality because they cant figure out how to successfully integrate back into society without accepting they arent supersmart and they dont know secrets the sheeple dont they dont know what they dont know because they discard anything they disagree with or dont understand i wont let up on these people theyve killed americans and counting i just want to force the facts down their godforsaken throats so we can move on with lessons learned because heres the problem with not separating church and state god creates pedophiles satan is the one that punishes them why would you trust a pedophilecreating god to determine whats legal thats just insane lets let the people determine whats good for the people not pedophilecreating god,0,kosg2b

the truth about islam you have to read this after seeing this post i had to intervene first of all op says that of his muslim friends left islam and they dont like it well its only their personal opinions it doesnt mean anything there is nearly billion other muslims than your friends who like it there are very educated and smart people who have converted to it like professor jeffrey lang for an example professor of mathematics at university of kansas and a former atheist and many others than him so its clear that your friends opinions has no real value regarding the religion its just their opinions secondly the quran states that there is no other god than allah god its he who sent moses jesus mohammed and all the other famous prophets thats because we hadhave people who worship cowsmicefireetc so god is saying dont worship them they are only my creations i created all these things and there is no other creator than me im the only creator muslims dont hate christians or jews in fact if you look at egypt for an example it has the largest christian population in the middle east and north africa although the majority are muslims if we hated them they wouldnt be living with us they would have left and if you watch a recent debate on youtube called antizionism is antisemitism at you will see that ilan papea jewish historian literally says that jews have been treated in the middle east better than they have been treated in europe thirdly about the verses that talk about war it either was a special occasion or generally btw the quran verse isnt about wars its not literal its figurative when god says war there islam is a religion that guides people in their life wars are parts of this life so it makes sense that god would speak about them in the quran but what op is doing now is called not seeing the whole picture islam is more than just the quran as you know but there is also hadiths why didnt he mention this very famous hadith dont kill a womandont kill a child dont kill an old person etc when usa invaded iraq to steal their oil and gold he didnt care when the usa destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki killing many women and children in the process he didnt say anything so op stop being a hypocrite and also this is a very important verse that is a general rule as you see it now becomes clear that he is only focusing on some verses and completely ignoring others confirmation bias fourthly the only thing he got right is that islam prohibits homosexuality if you want to know why use youtube because if i write about it it would take too much time but i will quickly give an example years ago alcohol was prohibited in islam although nearly everyone was drinking it at that time it is only now that we were able to know the many harmful effects of it when porn films were invented in the century if you ask any muslim he would tell you its prohibited but you wouldnt really understand why you wouldve probably thought they are just normal films for adults and its ok to watch them it was only recently that the harmful effects of porn were discovered visit the nofap subreddit lol fifthly the quran verses are not even about marriage they are about divorce and it literally has nothing to do with children im a native arabic speaker if op is reading this please go learn some arabic you are embarrassing yourself and for the sahih muslim d hadith you completely misunderstood it the wife of the prophet means its ok to lay in front of someone who is praying and she was mad at the person who said she cant and was saying like we are not donkeys or dogs we can lay finally the verse about beating women the right meaning is discipline them gentlyim a native arabic speaker unlike him and if you need some more evidence that islam doesnt oppress women at any way here are some so you can see the full picture fatima ra is a part of me and he who makes her angry makes me angry sahih albukhari and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought surah arrum fear allah in respect of women and the best of you are they who behave best to their wives and a muslim must not hate his wife and if he be displeased with one bad quality in her let him be pleased with one that is good fear allah regarding women verily you have married them with the trust of allah abu hurairah reported that a man came to the messenger of allah peace be upon him and asked o messenger of allah who is the person who has the greatest right on me with regards to kindness and attention he replied your mother then who he replied your mother then who he replied your mother then who he replied your father jahimah came to the prophet peace be upon him and said messenger of allah i want to join the fighting in the path of allah and i have come to seek your advice he said then remain in your mothers service because paradise is under her feet the list is bigger but thats enough for now being an atheist is your choice but lying about a religion to produce a false image of it to people who have no real knowledge of it and they cant understand arabic is unacceptable if op is reading this you should be ashamed of yourself i only wanted to tell you the truth behind this post since it had upvotes im not here to make you join islam or debate with you about atheism if you have questions about islam you have google and youtube please dont trust a nonmuslim and someone who cant speak arabic well

god is above science how would you respond to that sort of argument this is more sort of a rant i had an argument with someone who once was my friend they said that if they ever had covid their prayers would help them recover from it they also said that if they suffer andor die then its gods plan i told them not to mix god with science only for them to say that god is above science at first i responded that if god had a plan for you to suffer or die then he would be a very cruel god i think this offended them somehow they said that they couldnt care less about science if god says otherwise,0,kpno6i

read bottom before criticism pls then give thoughts i came to see why the entire internet uses this subreddit as the butt of every joke against athiests and reddit in general and i totally see why now yall are way too negative on here like idec if yall are right about how god doesnt exist youre all just so hostile you dedicate too much time hating on christians and their beliefs to realize that youre just turning or have already turned into sour people like just chill out idk what happened to some of yall but nobody is generally this way if you have a healthy relationship friends and hobbies and stuff it seems like yall are just heavy antitheists instead of just believing in nothing like youre too angry at christians when they could probably care less,0,kq55km
do theists use their problem solving skills when trying to explain the existence of a god the reason i have started to think about this is because of a personal experience i had a few weeks ago at my university theres this dude lets call him nick whos quite a smart student hes studying both physics and mathematics and hes so good at it that he can even be a little arrogant about it sometimes up to the point that hell laugh behind your back if you cannot comprehend a fourteendimensional nonorientable manifold without the use of paper hes very passionate about science and loves what hes doing at the same time i would call it unfortunate that he grew up in a pretty christian family so were talking about not accepting homosexuality antiabortion believing that noahs flood actually happened claiming that a gay marriage isnt an actual marriage etc which are claims you usually dont hear anymore in the netherlands and so whenever i talk to nick i can get a very elaborate explanation on why a certain natural process takes place how it happens why it could not happen otherwise according to the laws of physics and thermodynamics etc etc so a few weeks ago we happened to be in a context where people talked about their religions and i wanted to see how science and belief could work together in his mind and i asked him this as you know the laws of physics say you cant just magically summon water from nothing so did your god defy the laws of physics to flood the earth and if he did flood the earth why would you study physics if your god can defy these laws at any moment in time and it seemed like nick had an answer ready but it was nothing like the answer he usually gives when i ask him stuff like why a crayon cannot just jump in midair on itself well i believe the water was there for a purpose and because it had a purpose it had to be there so first off this does not adress the question at all but it also doesnt use any scientific logic that he spent so much time on and i see this more often with religious people where they are completely capable of making completely normal logical decisions but their logic gates just seem to slam shut as soon as something religious comes up does anyone know if this is because a person like nick could be using a different part of the brain whenever he deals with religious topics i mean when people talk about morality they dont use their problem solving skills either so perhaps religious people arent thinking about religion in the right cirtical way when someone is trying to challenge their belief if anyone knows any scientific research that i could read thatd be greatly appreciated,0,kp21yt

oldest brothers christian friend burned my pentagram flag i went to a metal concert with my ex a few years ago and some dude was wearing a satanic pentagram flag like a cape came up to my then girlfriend and kept messing with her even though she and i told him multiple times to leave her alone i caught up with him in the mosh pit and knocked him out and took his flag as a spoil ive recently used it as a curtain in my new room at the house my brother and i are fixing up to move into he gets his best friend hes had since childhood to go help him work on the house after christmas my brother comes back and tells me his friend upon seeing it ripped it down and chucked it in a fire im aware thats willful destruction of someones property and im quite upset that someone whom ive known all my life would do something like that it was a memento of a great night of seeing some bands my ex and i were into and ill miss it of course but not because it was a satanic symbol but because of that specific night of fun and good memories its things like that that make people like us angry at christians in the first place i wouldnt go to his office and destroy his model nazi warships just because they have swastikas on them cause i know hes not a nazi so why would he do that to my property when he knows full well im not a devil worshipper a bit of a vent and a bit of asking you all what you would do in this situation i personally would just buy a new flag theyre not hard to come by and theyre pretty cheap if you go through the right sources,0,kpzw4s

the asymptote of evidence a model for how ideas get so divided this is really long and bad i think ill clean it up later but i just want to get the idea out there its lofty title and im sure i dont have the background to back it up and im sure some phisosopher has said this same thing better over a hundred years ago in fact this is just describing cult indoctrination but i thought this idea was interesting and i figured i would share it people at my work have recently become interested in the navy uap videos we do infrared imaging and we have some unexplained videos on our shared drive there is one ufo guy who made a really good presentation on them and at first i was really impressed with the evidence having seen the xkcd about that i asked him if it could be explained by something ordinary and of course he said there is no way this has to be some sort of advanced technology and i believed him i looked into it further eventually finding thunderfoots videos on them at first i though ok thunderfoot explained the navy videos but he hasnt seen our unexplained videos maybe our videos are truly unexplained after looking at our videos i was convinced that we didnt have a single video that was unexplained and i brought this evidence to the ufo guy and i said paraphrasing either this is a bird or its some advanced technology moving at knots moving in a way to perfectly disguise itself as a bird naturally this didnt change ufo guys thoughts a being able to produce technology capable of moving at knots with no form of propulsion surely would be able to detect that we were looking at it then move perfectly to imitate a bird until we lose sight of it and this gave me the idea for this analogy that our beliefs are like a graph of y x and evidence can move us back and forth in the x direction the limit of this function as it approaches zero is dependent on the direction you approach it from if you approach from the positive direction it goes to positive infinity and if you approach from the negative direction it goes to negative infinity so if you approach this uap thing from the positive direction already believing that alien spacecraft visiting earth is unlikely then seeing evidence that this could be explained by a bird pushes you even more in that direction convincing you even more that there is no advanced technology visiting earth on the other hand if you go in convinced there is an alien presence on earth then the evidence that this is either a bird or something disguising itself as a bird pushes you more to the belief that this is some advanced technology i think you can see where this goes in the atheism discorse a person convinced that there is an all powerful omniscient omnibenevolent creator of the universe wont think twice about this creator making a sytem where apparent random suffering plagues the universes inhabitants of course an omni creator could do this if he already created the universe he is capable of anything and the fact that he created a universe with apparent suffering just goes to show how smart he is that he can plan all this out so well that suffering always leads to a greater good but the skeptic who approaches this problem goes wait so not only does this guy had to have created the universe he also had to plan it so perfectly that any appearance of suffering is actually a good thing i find it much more likely that the universe is simply indifferent to the presence of humans the same evidence given to two different people pushes them in opposite directions depending on what beliefs the people started with like moving to an asymptote from two different directions and this goes with many ideas causing division in politics today have you heard the icecaps are melting to one person this is proof that the earth is simply coming out of an ice age a part of a natural cycle to another person this is proof of how much humans are affecting the environment lawsuits about election fraud failed look at how good they are at hiding the election fraud they are so good at hiding it we cant prove it on the other hand if you approach it with the idea that the trump administration is seriously corrupt then this evidence just goes to further prove that trump is a severely corrupt politician who would do anything to preserve his power this is not to say both sides are equal one side is right and the other is wrong but it shows why it is so hard to change someones mind youre not just fighting one idea youre fighting the whole ecosystem of ideas someone has in their head and moving up the asymptote in the wrong way is a lot easier than flipping over to the other side,0,kqovv8

christian friend has been trying to convert me for over a year im an upper year student at a christian college im also an atheist at the beginning of last year i became friends with a guy during orientation whenever we would have a conversation he would always steer the conversation to religion at first i was openminded because i was agnostic at the time so i would listen in on what he had to say i even went to his church later on in the year but have never gone back since most of his earlier conversations consisted of telling me how horrible hell is and then switched to how atheism doesnt make sense and how beneficial christianity is it got to the point where i would avoid him because every conversation felt exhausting very few times we had a talk that wasnt about religion after only months of meeting him he asked me whats holding me back from converting to christianity after which he said me an extremely lengthy evangelical email trying to get me to accept christianity the email ended with him saying you and i lets walk in the kingdom of god together the following semester he mentioned how he often prays for me and hopes i come to christianity additionally he has sent me numerous evangelical videos over the course of the year overall he has been trying to evangelize me for over a year now i was never really direct with him by telling him im not going to convert because i didnt want to hurt his feelings after exams ended before this christmas a couple of my friends this guy included went to a bonfire i made a joke about converting to islam and he responded by saying that would be better than being an atheist i didnt say anything at the time but that comment really pissed me off recently he sent me yet again a video about a christian vs atheist debate i finally had it and gave him a reply saying that im never going to convert and i dont appreciate his constant efforts of trying to convert me i asked if he could just respect my boundaries regarding this he replied saying he wasnt trying to convert me with the video but just wanted my thoughts i pretty much gave him my thoughts and the conversation fizzled out on christmas i sent him a message wishing him well and just got a three word response saying yeah you too was i overly harsh i feel like its my fault for not being more honest earlier on is there any good way to handle the evangelical types,0,kogaru

does anyone ever get accused of disrespecting religious poc when you say that white supremacy and christianity are linked i got into an argument with someone today when i mentioned the horrible protests at the capitol in dc today they put up a wooden cross and i commented how disgusting they were and how the founding fathers werent even religious he said that it was more about racism than christianity and i argued back that the two were pretty much linked the dude says that i offended his belief and that not all of christianity is about white supremacy i walked back my statements but in my head i thought ok but christianity was literally forced on slaves by white men so if anything its like religious stockholm syndrome i obviously wasnt gonna say that to cause more trouble but it bothers me that people ignore the plain and simple fact that christianity and white supremacy are inextricably linked has anyone else encountered similar frustrations i dont wanna generalize all christians as white supremacists because thats not true but it literally cant be ignored that white supremacy found its roots within christianity and the two go hand in hand,0,krvunc
im losing hope hi everyone i know things have been quite crazy with coronavirus and all but im hoping youve managed to pull through ive created this post to get some advice on how i can move forward in life especially with my ageing parents i grew up in a semireligous islamic household that ive tolerated for as long as i could recently my mental health has gone really bad and i cant stop hating myself for not being able to build the courage to come out with who ive become everytime i feel ready to come out with it other thoughts come into my head which heightens my feeling of guilt about the aftermath of what can potentially happen my parents grew up in poor conditions from their country of birth in south asia moved to uk in the s which is partially why their mentality is firm with what they believe i have one sister who has married and moved out last year and im the only son who is expected to look after them my parents have predetermined my life from the moment they gave birth to me pretty much they expect me and my wife of their selection to look after them when theyre too old to work or look after themselves and im not even exadurating one bit the current home my parents have bought on mortgage was unaffordable but they were receiving benefits as me and my sister were still young they were hoping once i turn when the benefits stop i would give them most of my uni loan and once i graduate and have a job it would pay off the rest of the house im turning in a few weeks and i barely make enough to survive on my own i couldnt handle uni because the misery of my situation so i left as i didnt want to study in the city i grew up in they wouldnt let me my mother constantly reminds me that the house we live in is in my name it was bought for me i dont know if its her trying to show affection or her trying to manipulate me into staying i really dont think theyll survive on their own but i cant get on with their religious lunacy and i cant even say what ive become because im scared about what can happen to me in terms of my safety i really hate being a closeted apostate it affects my daytoday mental wellbeing dating etc all i want to do is move out and live in liberation at this point im willing to take any help i can get im sorry to sound like im begging but im really on edge and havent been socialising with friends or family for months thank you for taking your time out to read this i love you all and i hope you have a nice day ,0,krctnr
not sure what type of atheist i am basically i watched prophet of zods video dumb things people say to atheist part and realized that i might actually not be atheist as i thought i was im not sure what i would be categorized in based on what i believe basically i despise christianity and other abrahamic religions primarily to the fact that i was raised in a religious cult and have been liedverbally abused to this entire time some atheist youtubers and you guys in this subreddit further cemented my hatred of abrahamic religions however i dont feel as much hate towards hinduism and buddhism because im not very aware of what their beliefs are and the theological contradictionslogical fallacies they have basically the contradiction parts apply to my opinion of the abrahamic religions however as im aware that being areligious can possibly be the right opinion to me i want to dive further into the proof against all religions we have thus far discovered i just dont have that motivating push factor in me yet to do so what am i,0,kpx8uf
looking for a little bit of guidance here relatively early last year was when i first realized that i was no longer a christian and claimed the label of atheist and of course logically i know that that is the worldview that is most reflective of reality because it is the one supported by like any amount of evidence that being said ive recently kind of settled into it more and now im realizing that it is incredibly hard for me to live without that security blanket of believing in spirituality and an afterlife especially theres no way i can go back to believing something that obviously has no truth to it but how do you cope with the idea of eternal nothingness after death how do you cope with being afraid of losing everyone and everything you love like your life never even happened how do you live with the crushing sense of emptiness and horror about whats inevitably coming i try to force myself to be grateful for what i have now but it feels like im constantly pushing panicked thoughts out of my head about just never experiencing anything again and at this point its kind of ruining my life please if anyone feels the same id appreciate any coping methods you may have to share at least a response would make me feel like im not quite so alone im sorry this is so dark and depressing by the way this has just been the inside of my mind constantly for about a month or two now,0,koqir4

til archaeological evidence shows us the dark ages really happened christians dont like the term dark ages because it implies christianity only achieved cultural ascendancy after western europe sank into superstition ignorance moral degeneracy and barbarism the belief the dark ages are a myth can be traced to peter browns book the world of late antiquity which sought to portray the years between ad positively as a period of peaceful cultural innovation needless to say this couldnt be further from the truth in prominent archaeologist bryan wardperkins set out to expose this view for the ideologically motivated falsehood it really is in his book the fall of romevonepageandqandffalse he writes it is currently deeply unfashionable to state that anything like acrisis or a decline occurred at the end of the roman empire let alonethat a civilization collapsed and a dark age ensued the new orthodoxy is that the roman world in both east and west was slowly andessentially painlessly transformed into a medieval form however thereis an insuperable problem with this new view it does not fit the mass ofarchaeological evidence now available which shows a startling decline inwestern standards of living during the fifth to seventh centuries this wasa change that affected everyone from peasants to kings even the bodies ofsaints resting in their churches it was no mere transformationit wasdecline on a scale that can reasonably be described as the end of acivilization in the book wardperkins marshals together an impressive array of evidence the dark ages were a real historical occurrence he shows that far from being peaceful the fall of rome was a largely unpleasant affair accompanied by much violence and bloodshed his analysis of the evidence is very thorough he uses the dramatic decline in quality of pottery and housing the scarcity of coinage the almost total disappearance of literacy and the vanishing population of western europe because of declining agricultural output to show that neither western nor eastern halves of the roman empire were left unscathed by the dark ages by the seventh century the standard of living in the west had returned to prehistoric levels the fall of rome by bryan wardperkins is an excellent book by a professional archaeologist to boot that counters the silliness of christian apologists and other hacks who want to close their eyes to the evidence and pretend the dark ages were really a golden age,0,krjmno
why wouldnt an allpowerful allknowing and allmerciful god provide us with enough evidence to believe in his existence why should we have to accept his existence and his miracles on faith alone assuming he exists and assuming he possesses all of these omni characteristics providing us with enough verifiable easily replicated evidence of his existence should be a trivial matter if he created us as sentient beings with the capacity to reason isnt it counterproductive to expect us to rely on faith for knowledge of god if his moral perfection is truly infinite he would have to give us sufficient evidence of his existence since faith cannot be used to distinguish between truth and falsehood yet he does not do this which indicates quite clearly he doesnt possess any of these traits assuming he exists the god works in mysterious ways trope is not an answer some religious people say god cant provide us with sufficient evidence of his existence because it would interfere with our free will thats like saying giving someone instructions on how to handle explosive chemicals or take medications with potentially dangerous side effects interferes with free will far from interfering with free will additional information enhances it allowing us to make more informed decisions so again the god of the omnis has no excuse to not provide us with sufficient evidence of his existence,0,krk7na

watching my family during the pandemic has made me antireligious but not to much thinking out loud and a request i was raised in a very conservative christian family but ive been openly atheist since high school at that time my parents tried everything to get me back to church taking both cars so i wouldnt be able to go anywhere else eating out at restaurants after church screaming at me that ill go to hell etc and after some time things settled down and my father and i have had respectful discussions about god at this point i was a friendly atheist not believing that any god exists on dawkins scale but mostly ambivalent about others receiving satisfaction meaning and morals from their religion watching my family during the pandemic changed that and the first inklings started with my youngest brothers science education hes not the brightest but isnt afraid of asking questions unfortunately those questions are answered with religion why are people racist original sin why do those little birds hummingbirds fly differently than other ones god made them that way how did people come up with computers god inspired them and i care less that these answers are wrong and more that they immediately simply end the line of questioning with no steps to investigate further explore a curiosity or validate what hes told and its exactly this sort of thing that makes education important teaching kids to ask and explore questions and exposing them to ideas and problems not known to their parents exactly the opposite of what happens when you send your kids to a private religious school that teaches exactly what you believe i cant imagine how much social and scientific progress weve lost to these sorts of institutions and that was my first inkling of antireligiosity note not antispirituality i have no problems with individual experiences of god comforting existential dread but what is antireligious the last thing i want is to tell others what they cannot believe theres immense economic and social value in freedom freedom of speech freedom of belief freedom of press the ability to write say and pray about any idea stands behind the influx points of human history christians celebrate luthers theses scientists admire galileos stand for copernican heliocentrism and americans blowup stuff in memory of the revolution from monarchy to democracy how many more great concepts went unsaid for fear of persecution and ideas can help and harm martin luthers writing challenged the power of the pope but his antisemitic views were used by the nazis to support their attacks on the jewish horrible shouldnt we try to silence the hate and violence christianity directs at muslims see trumps muslim bans or the lgbtq community and in on liberty johnsteward mill argues that its wrong to silence any opinion because silencing even one opinion robs the human race if the opinion is right people are deprived of an opportunity to find truth if it is wrong people gain a clearer perception of truth and when i learn my parents brought two of my siblings from different universities and a friend home for the pandemic went on two vacations and have been going to inperson bible study and occasionally church today im livid but i also learn that unquestioning faith in unfalsifiable and unmistakably harmful beliefs is a bad idea so as much as i dislike an idea or organization it has value in showing me what not to do and im heartened to learn increasing percentages of atheism in younger generations but i also feel a responsibility to them i didnt ask to be born and in many ways life sucks so its my duty to make life suck less for others around me and those after me leading me to my request how can an individual reduce the amount of humanonhuman violencehate should i attempt to expose my siblings to other viewpoints against my parents strict order and note i know great good can be financially in advancing health wealth and education and recommend but my question is particularly about reducing hate and violence,0,kps7ng

archdiocese of cologne journalists leave meeting with the church after being told to sign a nda to read expert report on sexual abuse archdiocese of cologne access to expert reports only with a declaration of confidentiality a journalists meeting on the subject of abuse planned at the archdiocese was broken off because the reporters present were unwilling to sign a confidentiality agreement requested by the church in the conversation the reporters should actually be given the opportunity to read a partially blackened copy of a legal opinion that deals with cases of sexual abuse by priests in the past decades the archbishop of cologne decided last year not to publish this because it had methodological errors the journalists should now legally undertake not to publish the events of the report or to name the responsible persons named therein all the journalists present rejected this the archdiocese of cologne is of the opinion that for legal reasons there is no other way by next week those responsible now want to check whether under different conditions they can still give journalists an insight into the report on sex offenders in the cologne archdiocese and their confidants ,0,kr8p9w

happy new year speaking of the new decade perhaps this is the decade where you all will stop all of this pretending and just accept the fact that god is real you all dont really disbelieve in the lord and know that acting like a rebellious atheist wont actually save you from the reality you wish didnt exist im sorry but there are a lot of people running around calling themselves atheist these days but theyre really just fighting to avoid god just based on your subs post history yall literally talk about god more than the average person who identifies themselves as christian i know yall are going to deny this but you wouldnt feel the need to go out of your way to talk about god as much if you all were truly the atheists you all claim to be i know for a fact that if i wasnt a follower of christ i wouldnt waste my time discussing god just like i dont waste my time discussing everything i disbelieve in happy new year and god bless,0,ko42fl
the future of secularism here are just some thoughts i had ive been shifting back and forth between several beliefs and ideologies but my overall principles have always been firmly on the side of freedom and secularism recently ive come to realize that there isnt really a clear picture on how to move forward on these values i see this particularly in the bizarre embrace of mainly the left of islam but also on the right with the embrace of ever more radical forms of christianity which not only embraces creationism and full on disease denial but is now moving into a pretty creepy direction of hyper traditionalism which sometimes even involves outright antisemitism of course id rather not have these people take control so allow me to give my two cents in social dynamics theres a rule known as the minority rule this is a rule that is explained in the book skin in the game by nassim taleb and while i have my opinion on many of his questionable views over the last few years i do believe that this rule is of importance to the future of secularism this rule is also explored in an article on physics and society from from which a similar picture emerges you can read it yourself here basically the world is ruled by intolerant minorities they do so because they refuse to compromise while a majority although having larger numbers are flexible this means that given a significant amount of inflexibles say the majority will nearly always obey their wishes in order to avoid trouble this strikes me as a pretty good explanation for the increased level of religious fundamentalism religious fanatics have figured out that not compromising gets stuff done this is a horrifying prospect to me and i feel that in order for societies to remain secular secularists and those in favor of free speech democracy and equality need to become aware of the minority rule that leads me to a tip stand your ground and dont compromise on these values theyre more important and above all more fragile than you think,0,krlc73

if you ask what is the churches stance on something then you are in a way worse cult while i think all religions are bad the ones that have a church leader issuing whats right and wrong is just next level terrible why should it matter what your church leader says if you believed the leader is some medium to god i hope you have a way to determine that the guy is the one true puppet of god see i would take the people who say i feel it in my heart rather than well the pope is the voice of god and thats saying something you cannot know what the pope or the church leaders knows at least you know more about your own mind,0,ko6nxq

if you make a religious claim but say that your claim is different and doesnt need vigorous verification then yes your religious ideology is clashing with science so far the scientific method is much better than any other method that religious people use if you claim that religion is compatible with science then please understand that when you make a claim you cannot simply say the biblequran said so therefore its true that is not how the scientific method works if before you take a drug you would like it to go through testing but you shrug and just say i just have faith that prayer works yes those to are in opposition with each other its funny that benign things or things out of your control are things you just have faith in but things you know have dire consequences you dont just have faith,0,kp6dwp

these are the main reasons i left christianity in no particular order if god is omniscient why would he create beings whom he knew in advance were destined for hell the religion one believes is heavily correlated with geography being born in india makes it far more likely that you will be hindu than christian for cultural reasons does this mean being born in certain areas makes it far more likely that you will make it into heaven than being born in other places sounds rather arbitrary why would a loving god send people to eternal torture simply for not believing in him sounds rather vain and selfabsorbed the catholic churchs opposition to birth control is one of the most irrational and indefensible positions of which i am aware i know not all christian denominations are antibirth control but when i learned of the catholic opposition i immediately stopped calling myself a catholic birth control prevents the spread of stds alleviates generational poverty prevents unwanted pregnancies and unloved children allows for women to be better educated prevents unlimited population growth and even prevents abortions its just plain stupid for an organization that opposes abortions to also oppose the number one thing that would prevent abortions i knew a lot of nonreligious people who seemed to live perfectly happy and fulfilling lives peoples lives shouldnt be dictated by their gender or sex when my conservative eightysomething grandfather said that he thought the catholic church should get with the times and allow women priests bishops etc that was an eyeopener for me to just how regressive and just plain sexist some religious rules are a lot of religions seem to push traditional stereotypes that women dont like sex and must dress modestly to keep safe from sexcrazed men which i think is equally offensive to both sexes why the hell would the creator of the universemultiverse care so much about your sex life or the way you style your hair why would a deity care whats so bad about sex anyway how am i pure for being a virgin what about a penis removes innocence how is something immoral if it doesnt harm anyone why is homosexuality a sin its even been observed in nonhuman animals i personally used to be a homophobe but then i realized there was no nonreligious reason to condemn homosexuality whats so bad about love some religious sects such as jehovahs witnesses and the amish actively oppose education and learning beyond a certain threshold when youre discouraged from learning theres a big hint youre being lied to i used to be antiabortion then i realized that abortions prevent unwanted children from growing up unloved abused in poverty etc sometimes the mother is addicted to drugs sometimes the fetus has horrible abnormalities sometimes the mother is underaged have compassion pregnancy is no small matter furthermore while it may be questionable to abort an eightmonth fetus for the first few weeks at least a fetus definitely isnt sentient for a really wonderful article on the subject read carl sagan and ann druyans essay is it possible to be both prolife and prochoice i used to be antiassisted suicide but then i realized that there is a difference between living and existed if i ever forgot my name or permanently lost control of my bowels or was in pain beyond comprehension i wouldnt want to live anymore if i ever get diagnosed with a terminal illness i would much prefer to be able to die on my own terms maybe with a few loved ones gazing out upon a scenic view rather than withering away awaiting the inevitable while struggling to breathe in a hospital bed somewhere some people say its giving up but i think that if anything its more dignified and honorable to face your fate with acceptance i consider myself someone who supports animal rights i intend on becoming a vegetarian and limiting my consumption of dairy and eggs immediately upon moving away from my parents science has shown that animals feel pain and suffer just like humans they too can feel love and joy most of the differences between humans and nonhuman animals are in degree only many religious traditions assert that only humans will get to experience an afterlife why are we alone gods chosen species the fact that so many religious people vote republican is appalling the republican party has a sickening history of destroying the environment for profit putting many peoples lives biodiversity and simple aesthetic beauty at risk for their own personal benefit they also tend to enact policies that benefit corporations and billionaires at the expense of the working class ironic for people whose religions often stress charity its weird that followers of the prince of peace are so adamant about their guns i dont need religion to live happily yes several dozen years of life is indubitably infinitesimally short in compassion to eternity living indefinitely though probably not literally forever would be nice but im ok with dying also about billion people have died in the past fifty thousand years many of them better people than i i know im insignificant in the immensity of space and time but i dont care i can make my own meaning in the things that i do and the people i love whether or not there is a deity or an afterlife is beyond human comprehension there may very well be but i dont know and dont pretend to i can live with the ambiguity creationism is nonsense a disgrace to science i know not all religious people are creationists but to believe in your own fantasies in spite of the evidence to refuse to question your beliefs to purposefully align the evidence with the preheld conclusion is the epitome of antiscience there sorry for the length i dont expect you to respond to all

frustrations with religion after deconverting i deconverted about months ago my mental health is so much better than where it was previously in my life the constant irrational thoughts of eternal damnation no longer loom over my mind whenever i commit a sin im so much happier and can finally fully invest myself into things i really i care about i realize for me i try to be as rational as possible when making any decision when i was previously religious i would still try to be as rational as possible as well even if the decisions were contradictory to my religious beliefs over time as i became less religious and the cognitive dissonance between my rational beliefs and religious beliefs was building i had to really think hard about what i really believed in it was difficult but i came to the conclusion that i could not rationally be religious and that i would need to dismiss my religious belief system my problem is i dont know how to take people seriously when i know theyre religious their belief system is based on texts that are perfect and errorfree but we know have hundreds or so of historical and scientific errors how can you take someone seriously when their ideology is unscientific and irrational more popular now is it seems people pick and choose what they believe from their religious texts so they can still hold a rational set of beliefs i previously had this dilemma and i dont know how people could pick and choose i couldnt pick and choose this was one of my major headaches when i was previously religious these texts are proclaimed to be errorfree since the texts are based on gods words and god cannot be wrong god is perfect and allknowing you choosing to believe certain aspects vs rejecting others must imply that these previously held notions of god must be wrong if not then who are you to decide if the information is wrong or not since god is allknowing compared to you i dont know how people have rationally answered this question if the conclusion was the former then why hold any set of beliefs that are based on a text containing errors and how can you continue to believe in or base your beliefs on something that was proclaimed to be errorfree but proven to contain errors and you yourself are implicitly stating this i know its tough to sort these contradictions out but my problem is with people who knowingly hold contradictory ideologies and are okay with that i dont know how on earth you could be okay with that this was the very thing that made me anxious depressed and ruined my sleep before i deconverted i find it difficult to take someone seriously if they are at the very least not bothered by contradictory belief systems if they base a part of their beliefs on religion i dont know what others thoughts on this are this is where my frustrations stem from,0,ko8zjt

my firsthand experiences with mormonism and sexismshaming i was in the mormon church starting when i was born and ending when i left the church for good when i was the church teaches insane levels of sexism and rape culture my first memory of experiencing this was when i was around or years old i was wearing a pretty pink dress my grandma got for me that i was in love with because it made me look like a princess my sunbeam teacher who was a missionary that day for whatever the reason sat down with me to play with dolls and he mentioned to me that my dress was too short and was inappropriate to wear this made me cry so the missionary found my mom and told her what happened in the good ole mormon missionary way and she took his side and made me not wear that dress outside of the house ever again jump to year old me in young women the lesson that day was on modesty the leader of the lesson had a stick of gum chewed it up and then offered it to the class she related the piece of gum to us if we were to have sex or be intimate before marriage nobody would want us because were used the boys our age got to go on fun camping trips play basketball and going hiking or biking while us girls stayed in and cooked or did home crafts like sewing or knitting i am fairly attractive and a lot of the guys at church were into me during my preteenteen years people started to notice guys following me around or talking to me often and i was slutshamed for it the bishop invited me into his office several times asking me if i was sexually pure and if i was dating any of the guys in our ward when he would have zero reason to believe such things apart from seeing me talk to guy friends or guys talking to me between classes or if there was possibly people in our ward gossiping about me or approaching the bishop and telling him to talk to me about it even then it was so uncomfortable sitting alone with a grown man and explaining that i was still a virgin and delving into details about my personal life like that people often say its the people in the church thats the problem not the church itself but the problem with that is that the people are what makes up the church sick shit thanks for coming to my ted talk id really love to hear anyone elses experiences with mormonism or any other religion and how to heal from damage done after leaving,0,kp6y5s

arguments against deism deism is a minimalist religious perspective drawn from inferences and deductions one can make about the natural world it also encourages the rejection of supernatural or authoritarian claims which are often found in competing religious systems deism is the belief that our universe was created by a god but that theres little if any evidence that such a god intervenes in human or earthly matters it stops short of making any specific claims about god or promoting any particular holy book deism rejects claims that rely on supernatural occurrences or revealed knowledge this is in contrast to most major religions whose entire foundations are built on ancient revealed knowledge a deist accepts that our universe seems to be the product of an intelligent intentional creator but has little to go on when it comes to time to describe that creator why do deists believe in a creator but not a personal god deists base their beliefs in empirical evidence much like is done in science they believe enough evidence exists to justify assuming that our universe is the product of a creator or higher being but are not persuaded by arguments for an intervening political god that keeps his ear pressed to the other side of our clouds or selectively interferes with individual humans,0,kpqt7a

do quantum mechanics prove does it prove the church is a shit stain blocking the light from reaching all should it not prove you have god in yourself and the same god within us all as individual pieces some parts of the books written and combined via many cultures seems to point to a truth lying in the actions we take together or alone the devil and god are destroyed versions of what they may have once been considered in lost cultures yet they both must be a manifestation of actions taken to reality through our learned and actionable behaviors the good and bad are debatable to be not true or more than true when it comes to bettering your community so finally i ask do you believe the is some form of a creator allowing the manifestation of our realm to be as it is with the added evil of some being using their choice to simply have power and take control over the masses of people as a way to benefit greater than the mass over the masses combined effort,0,kpg10z
why is religion around the world i wish to more consice this time do you agree that many cultures wrote down strange explanations for what they could not explain at the time and now we are met with the outcome in the present time being a combination of facts of nature that have been passed off in misconscrewed ways to answer the questions of poorly educated people while simultaneously making loads of money from said people,0,krgfxo

is a st benedict medal useful if it is not blessed i am aware that the primary use of sacramentals such as rosaries and icons is to focus the mind towards contemplating god and prayer i have heard though that the st benedict medal is useful in guarding against evil and protecting against sin if i cannot get a medal blessed for whatever reason does this effect still exist can i carry the medal without it being blessed and will a general blessing work if i cannot find a priest that specifically knows how to bless a st benedict medal,1,kqpvpr

confused noncatholic in need of clarification as said above im not catholic and i know very little about their teachingscatechisms i was raised reformed a form of presbyterian if you are more familiar with that i have a really good friend who is catholic and we have a variety of conversations about all kinds of topics including theology and politics these topics met quite spectacularly when we ended up talking about abortion my view and the one kinda held by my denomination is that many anything that prevents babies from being killed are worth trying like better sex ed contraception and teaching teens about why they shouldnt do the stupid especially when dealing with nonbelievers forcing faith on them doesnt have a great history with preventing teen pregnancy she said that anything related to contraception is a sin and shouldnt be used even to prevent a baby from being born she also said that sex is only meant to be used to create children as someone who was raised beleiving that sex is a holy joining of man and wife in gods design this was strange to hear is this a mainstream belief held within the catholic church i am not judging her for her beliefs and i never will but i was curious about whether this whether this is mainstream catholicism or a more splinter group belief she couldnt explain very well why this is something she believed so i guess im asking for an explanation of this as well tldr is contraception a sin and is having sex only meant to make babies,1,kosize

question about st teresa of avilas nine grades of prayer and the rosary i was wondering with regards to st teresa of avilas nine grades of prayer she discusses in the interior castle just where the rosary lands it obviously fulfills the first two of vocal prayer and meditation but was curious if the rosary can ever become the grade of affective prayer or even the of acquired recollection beyond this i was curious if it was appropriate to use the rosary as your primary foundation to advance in prayer in this manner regardless i know that going beyond the first four grades is a matter of god bestowing his grace more so than direct action on our part but i was just curious overall if a broad set of devotional practices was needed to reach this point such as incorporating lectio divina or other prayers alongside the rosary thanks for any clarification you could offer,1,kq16m7

one catholic old lady surprised north korea authority i recently read a book written by north korean diplomat who left north korea and exiled to south korea he wrote lots of interesting story in his book and this story is one of them in the century north korean leader kim ilsung pushed for the visit of pope john paul ii under the direction of kim ilsung a team was set up within the foreign ministry to invite the pope and this included diplomat tae youngho author at the time the vatican demanded if there is a real catholic in north korea take him or she to the vatican and the security ministry found an old lady who was a believer before the korean war and they asked her if she believed in god the old lady said at first she believed in a great leader kim llsung man however north korean authorities persuaded her saying this is for the sake of our great leader so you can be honest with us eventually the old lady confessed that she believed in god and showed the place in her house where she had worshiped for decades north korean authorities took her to the vatican the old lady met the pope and showed faith that she had hidden for decades saying god who has come into my heart once never leave paradoxically however north korea gave up on the popes invitation project because of the her faith former diplomat tae said people at the vatican admitted that she is a true believer just by looking at her eyes adding through this work north korea felt the fear of religion he added,1,kqouk5

is the mass pagancatholic doubt i know this seems like a pretty common protestant accusation in the form of a question but im having doubts i have recently been struggling with whether or not the catholic church is the true church established by christ either it is or theyre idolatrous my doubts are probably stemming from salvation by faiths vs works and faith and then not understanding apostolic succession and how the fruits of the church seem to be lacking the confidence a lot of protestants have in their salvation is unfathomable to me and i wonder if my baptism was invalid now i am doubting the mass and whether it is just imitating paganism if anyone has any sources id appreciate it,1,kqngia

weight loss and gluttony help hello everyone happy new year i have some questions regarding gluttony and exercise becoming scrupulous in and ultimately much more engaged in my faith ive realized i have been gluttonous at many points in my life excessive eating of desserts and other foods like binge eating and ive stopped this however im afraid its gone to an extreme ive lost roughly of my body weight roughly lbs ive also lost a lot of muscle mass and this also ties into losing a will to exercise consistently which ive been failing to do does anyone have any tips on what i should do in this situation i try to limit my eating to strictly breakfast lunch and dinner i also feel convicted as sinning if i eat a dessert outside of these times i barely get to enjoy my self with desserts but i guess this is good since this indulgence of desserts would be gluttonous but how often is gluttonous obviously every day would be but is like having one chocolate every other day okay,1,ko6mxp

im reading confessions by saint augustine and i am mesmerized what a beautiful work i never thought i would have so much in common with a christian saint from years ago just like st augustine i spent my years in university thinking i was so modern and wise i didnt want to think about god he was in the back of my head but i ignored any of his convictions or his callings to me i thought i knew what was best for me i was so prideful i had suffered from injustices from others and these brought me into depression i shouldve brought it to god but i sought the world for answers instead the more i looked for answers in the world the more i was engulfed into sin and into darkness and into my pride i wanted to die i was suicidal and i hated myself so much i thought christianity was too shallow too conservative but i wanted answers i fell into marxism and feminism but all they did was feed my soul hate after looking for answers by indulging myself in a hedonistic lifestyle then trying to cure myself through therapy and a healthy lifestyle then falling into worldly teachings i was still suffering so much i finally said god i cannot do this i want to die i need you please forgive me for straying away from you for so long please heal my soul and let me feel your presence god is so faithful he answers those who knocks at the door he gives the water of life to those who thirst he has rescued me from my sins from the darkness that threatened to consume me praise god for his everlasting love his everlasting grace his everlasting mercy as st augustine said our hearts are restless until they can find rest in you if you have friends or family that have strayed away from the faith please just pray for them we have an almighty god he can work miracles,1,kozd34
im looking for encouragement as i seek jesus during a lockdown about a month ago i rededicated my life to jesus brothers and sisters let me tell you my eyes have been opened i have tasted gods love mercy and grace and i want to worship and follow him as he wishes for me my parents were catholic but converted into born again believers so i was raised in a protestant household i fell away from the faith while i was in university and by gods grace i have come back to him while i was non practicing i got married to my husband who is an agnostic catholic last year i attended a good friday ritual please excuse me i cant remember the exact name for it in mexico and i was in awe of the believers worship it was so beautiful i wondered why protestants didnt believe in rituals or beautiful artwork fast forward a year and a half i feel compelled to learn more about catholicism wow all i can say is that i was so ignorant about church history and tradition my whole view on christianity was solely on protestantism and the bible it never occurred to me to even look into the early church then i discovered orthodoxy im learning so much and i have been praying to god for discernment ive shared with my husband how jesus has turned my world upside down and how he has saved me and given me a peace i have never felt before my husband cried with me out of joy because he knows how i used to be suicidal and in so much pain with my ptsd yet i know he feels uncomfortable with my religious studies i tried sharing with him things ive learned so far comparing orthodoxy and catholicism the church history etc and he just seems to think it doesnt matter he thinks all religions are essentially the same anyway i cant have meaningful discussion with him on these topics because he doesnt believe in jesus he seems to get a little annoyed when i share a new fact ive learned ive been struggling a lot with choosing what path to go on i feel that i cant return to being a non denominational christian anymore but i dont know what to choose catholicism or orthodoxy its starting to make me anxious i just want jesus and im starting to get confused i wish i could go in person to churches and ask priests questions but i cant because of lockdown i dont really have religious friends either my family is very anti catholic so they would freak out if i told them any of these things brothers and sisters in christ please pray for me i really need encouragement,1,kq2tb6

death and gods will good day all i am a new member here and have come over from catholic answers forums which was such a valuable resource and has recently been forced to shut down for financial reasons anyway on to the main gist of my post i am a protestant exploring becoming catholic and i am continuing to study and pray on both the major and minor aspects of the faith my question we often hear protestants of various kinds say when a person dies well it was just his time or well it was gods will that he died so that got me to wondering is an individuals death generally speaking a part of gods permissive or active will does for instance god literally determine precisely when if not even how we are to die active will or does he simply permitallow us to die without any predetermined number of days or circumstances permissive will is there any ironclad even dogmaticinfallible teaching on this matter if so what would that be or are there merely a number of valid theological opinions on this if so what would you my dear reader conjecture on this matter thanking you in advance pax vobiscum misty,1,kqlfbz
why are catholics permitted to eat meat with blood still in it good day i was just reading through genesis where god allows noah and his sons to eat meat but specifically commands them not to eat meat with blood that is life in it yet catholics though not so much in the usa now and for centuries prior have been permitted to eat meat with blood in it eg the various blood sausages of eastern and western europe many arguments in favor of this practice have cited the jewish law as having been abrogated by the new christian dispensation and i could concur with this understanding however it appears that the commandment not to eat blood is not limited to jewish law but was commanded to noah and his descendants thus making the command universalfor all peoples so far when i have read arguments in favor of eating meat with blood still in it with reference to this nohaic passage the arguments given in my opinion have seemed very weak indeed so then what are the reasons that catholics can now eat meat with blood in it if genesis applied to noah and his descendants would seem to have universal application the strongest and in my opinion most sensible argument for how the noai passage should be applied ive read is as follows in levitical contexts not eating blood is commanded within the context of sacrifice in the nohaic pasage no mention at all is made of sacrifice and the nohaic covenant is mentioned not before or during but after the prohibition about eating meat with blood that is life in it so what may be meant here is that men should not eat meat while it is still alive with flowing blood still in its veins this argument cites later jewish literature targum that pretty much states the same thing so then we have some distinction between the noaic and mosaic commands and even a difference in meaning not to eat flesh with bloodlife in it this argument would be made stronger when we realize that most cultures now and throughout time do indeeeed kill animals before eating them sacrifice or not perhaps then the command is both prescriptive but maybe even more importantly descriptive of the present when the text was written cultural environment similarly arguably what much of genesis tries to show why the current state of man is as he is this would then eventually permit us now to licitly eat meat with blood if such is our taste this would also prevent extreme cruelty and suffering to animal life still what would then be the theological application to this passage since we almost always have a greater application than the temporal in biblical passages thoughts on all this misty,1,kra2sx

question about confession again ive been having trouble with intrusive thoughts that my brother suspects started in new years or the last day of all these intrusive thoughts are all blasphemous to god to the point that i felt like vomiting since then ive prayed but even in prayer these blasphemous thoughts still enter even as im typing this they still enter my thoughts theyre like that game of hit the weasel where they pop out of nowhere and i have to hit them with a bat ive had these intrusive thoughts before that i went back to my old self sinning for the most part even going to mass and taking it for granted anyway about the blasphemous thoughts last night after praying the rosary with my family and changing for bed i think ive finally committed blasphemy to god consciously i know he knows my actions and my intent and what im going through and that he knows my weakness and strengths as well but im so paranoid now that even if i do pray to god i know hell judge me on this once my time is over i dont think i should receive eucharist this sunday at all i know my mom will get mad at me again but shouldnt i be more afraid of god than my mom ive also been getting flashbacks of my past sins like stealing getting drunk and lying during my teens can god still forgive me for these they have confession schedules weekly here but im afraid if i go in this week theres a high possibility that ill still be having these intrusive thoughts,1,krl7qd
what is the catholic view on this quote by st mark when it comes to mortal sin there is a sin which is always unto death john the sin for which we do not repent for this sin even a saints prayers will not be heard st mark the ascetic so if we are in mortal sin and yet repentant but have not been absolved are we to have hope in our salvation especially when despair is a sin in itself is this a healthy way of looking at it im currently trying to recover from scrupulosity so just trying to figure out a healthy way to view all of this basically in the end we should not be indifferent toward the sacraments and our salvation but at the same time know that salvation belongs to the lord it seems like a balancing act all of the minute details when it comes to doctrine and dogma within the catholic church can drive someone with ocd andor scrupulosity crazy,1,kole7e
catechism questions always confused i would appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond im sure that i am not the only one but a lot of catholic theology wreaks havoc on my mind and im just trying to reconcile everything my first question im thinking i know the answer but scripture is above the catechism right for lack of a better term next i am wondering how the church can say in the catechism that imperfect contrition isnt enough to obtain forgiveness of mortal sins how would the church know that god wouldnt forgive it doesnt make sense to make such a statement especially in light of gods mercy and what christ tells us in scriptures and then my final question isnt imperfectperfect contrition irrelevant when a person attempts to do their very best to repent and turn to god especially as seen here in the catechism this reference there is no one however wicked and guilty who may not confidently hope for forgiveness provided his repentance is honest ccc all this causes distress because im genuinely trying to understand but all seems contradictory what do i do with this information,1,kp7ie8
is it possible to know our standing before god it seems impossible to know whether we are in a state of grace or a state of mortal sin the sacraments provide some assurance but i still wonder isnt it presumptuous for us to believe that we can know the mind of god likewise after having committed mortal sins how can i know that the lord hasnt or has indeed forgiven me in repentance it seems to me like the best we can do is frequent the sacraments and seek sincere repentance is this a good strategy also ive just been imagining a scenario lately where there is a person in a state of grace who isnt repentant vs a person in a state of mortal sin who is it seems that repentance is the beginning of salvation,1,kpvlqm
what is the difference between attraction and lost usually when this is asked the response is well lust is the reduction of a human being down to an object and well thats a great quick answer i dont quite understand what that means in practice is it lust if i look at an attractive woman and simply enjoy it if im not gogling at every bit of her body and thinking about seductively i know theology of the body says the sexual enjoyment is for those we have an emotional connection with and i also know that a common response is a your human its going to happen sometimes but that still implies that if i do catch myself enjoying the sight of a woman thats a stranger i need to instantly stop doing it im almost and ive never masterbated or watched legitimate porn its just something iv never had the chance to get addicted to but im obviously at a very ahem horny stage and its not hard for my body to get excited and i still dont know completely how to react in the case,1,kpbmgc

pray for this hateful maybe racist man this isnt the first time this year that ive dealt with random acts of hatred or racism im not sure if its because of the pandemic or because ive moved from california to the east coast but the amount of hate is starting to wear me down please pray for me so ive been doing online mass for awhile but have been going to adoration ever since jesus called me to do so theres a church that is minutes away from my house but has adoration from and so i go once or twice a week during advent i was just so excited for this season overall that ive been going back to mass in person everyone has been nice and kind however after mass today a man came up to me stared me in the eye and stuck up his middle finger at me i didnt know what he was doing but soon enough he got real close to me while walking by to hold it up so i could be sure its what he meant i was shocked for a few seconds but decided to follow him back into the church which he was walking towards after his hateful act i wanted to ask him if ive offended him in anyway but was pretty sure at this point hes a racist as im one of the only two asian woman at mass today not related to the other one i saw with her white husband everyone else was caucasian ive never met this man never bumped into him cut him in any line or spoken to him at any point in my life he was purely hating me for who i was the only other thing that stands out about me is that i veil maybe he hates women who do he avoided me after realizing i was going to confront him and went around the church took off his hat and pretended it wasnt him i went back around a quicker way and waited in the parking lot i found him identified him and took a photo of his back and license plate its really so that i could avoid him just in case he decides to be violent or harass me again anyways i no longer feel comfortable going to mass if im being watched and targeted i can no longer tell if someone is staring at me with curiosity or hate i really just want to vent and for everyone to please be kind to one another ill be fine and ive already cried it out with jesus during adoration soapbox time i am an american i speak perfect english im proud of our country on most days i pay taxes ive cried on ive voted at every election just like any american would its sad that i dont feel safe or loved in my own country i cant even imagine what my brothers and sisters that face this kind of hate often because they are different must have been going through if you see someone being mistreated stand up for them i will continue to be kind but i am definitely wary now hate will just breed hate so ill pray that i dont foster that same kind of hate and bias towards others shame on him for moments after receiving the holy eucharist and listening to an asian priest at mass to then target a single lady out just to show her his hatred but how sad it is that he must being going through so much and being tempted by the devil to blame his problems on someone undeserving thanks for reading lets all strive to be the light in the darkness,1,kpwc8z
would i be morally obligated to take my wife back i ask this as a hypothetical i highly doubt she will want to reconcile my wife told me she wanted a divorce a few months ago after never mentioning divorce to me before no counseling no nothing weve signed the papers and she has moved out shared custody of our young child our issues stemmed from difference in values i was a nonpracticing but believing nondenominational protestant when we met she was a true believing mormon tbm as they say with strict overbearing mormon parents she eventually came to realize that her mormon faith was a total crock with my help she has been an agnostic ever since around the time she lost her faith studying her religion made me take a major interest in my religion for the first time and i ended up converting to catholicism a year or two later my secular values started shifting following my conversion as her beliefs grew in the opposite direction about a year later we married and had a kid i wanted more kids and a slightly more traditional home life she has a career where working from home freelance is an option and i thought thats what would probably happen based on what she told me prior to marriage she slowly started to become more and more career oriented and wanted to stop having kids after our first our arguments which werent constant by any means were pretty explosive primarily on my end i have a bad temper im not proud of and i scream and use some very coarse language ive never ever been physical of course well to stop rambling she eventually sprung divorce on me said her therapist told her i was controlling and verbally abusive and left me i told her we should do couples counseling therapy that we could work through it ect didnt matter i personally think she hit her rebellious stage in her late s due to her ridiculously strict and overbearing mormon parents they had an unhealthy control over her well into our mid twenties and caused more than half of our fights she was always the perfect mormon daughter until she was like i personally think when she finally escaped her parents and her religion she realized she had married a person who had grown into also having distasteful religious values and corresponding family expectations and she wanted to escape it all and finally be herself so to speak now the point of this post after living on her own with no expectations from anyone sowing the wild oats she never got to sow in high school and college if she decides she made a mistake in breaking up her family do i have to take her back because a major part of me would want to mend our family of course but i would also be very resistant to taking her back after she ended our marriage and decided to be with other men if that were the case does this make sense i can forgive her and i hope she forgives me for all the wrongs i committed in our marriage im far from blameless but i would have never abandoned her after realizing i had far more loyalty than her it would be hard to just go back to how things were if and its a huge unlikely hypothetical if she did want to reconcile would i be morally obligated to as a catholic that would be quite a cross to carry if so but then again this whole situation has been my relationship with god has greatly suffered due to it im hoping i can turn it around this year sorry for the long rambling post by the way its kind of cathartic to type all of this,1,koitxy

monday politics best form of government and economic system hello i would like to ask questions about politics in a catholic insight i have read on a site that there are three legimit forms of government monarchy aristocracy democracy the corruption of these systems are called respectively tyranny oligarchy demagogy i have seen many in the church defending the democracy including members of the clergy can i defend a catholic monarchy today i dont know the role of the state but i suppose that its something like this to promote the common good i think that a democratic system is flawed because not always the majority of the citizen knows what is good for them although i defend that they should have participation in the public life but as kings collaborators so far i think that the monarchy is the best option regarding common good and the monarchy should be catholic i have thought the kings are forbidden to allow abortion for example its inconstitutional we might say and this rule has to be always in the constitution also i have this doubt can a government gives money to the church like tithe now i ask about economic system the socialist model is terrible and popular options are capitalism and distributism my questions are about the first can a catholic defend free market can the state interfere in the economy how,1,kq8ckx

newly married but i havent been baptized i was born a catholic but growing up my family never really participated i remember going to church about or times growing up after i left home and went to college i began to frequent the newman center at my school because i wanted to grow in my faith and learn more about my religion i have never been baptized but this is something that i often think about and it bothers me i was always told by family that if youre not baptized you will go to hell i dont know if thats true but if so i need to be baptized in the case of if i were to die i recently got married and because of the covid pandemic i was not able to be married in the church and i also havent been baptized which just makes me think how im living in sin i want to be baptized so bad and i want to be cleared of all my sins but im not sure where to start in since it seems like a process ive been told by some priests to get started i should begin some classes but i was just wondering if anyone can outline what i need to do in simple terms for me as well as outlining how i should approach the church about my marriage,1,kpa9d4

discernment vocation and a protestant background hey there so i know a couple of my concerns are going to sound silly but with my only real exposure to catholicism coming from the internet they still irk me im currently an episcopalian with super high anglocatholic leanings who attends a postliberal restoration movement stonecampbell movement is also another name christian college majoring in biblical studies im huge on ecumenical relations an orthodox student and i want to start a prayer group he already prays the rosary with another catholic student and i have loved the education the people and the community that has been shaping me with that being said i really dont want to throw shade or harbor ill will toward these experiences if i become roman catholic is it possible to see them as real people living their life for christ to the best of their abilities and be grateful for everything that has been handed down to me from their traditions both my schools and my current church secondly ive been drawn toward the religious life ever since i first heard about different orders in high school im to just give an idea at where im at in life the anglican communion does have quite a bit of orders that stem from their own ex ssje and influenced by traditional orders ex osb however im oddly attracted to the carthusians even though i come from a super close family which may break their heart to only ever see me days a year and being slightly talkative which the anglican communion doesnt have an equivalent i also find the roman orders to be weightier and more seeped in traditon even if the anglican communion has the exact same order so would it be bad to explore catholicism based on this longing for serving god and dedicating my whole self to him as a brother obviously im convinced of a lot of other catholic teachings so its not this alone i also have differing views about the ordination of women to at least the diaconate ive been raised in churches aog wesleyan and have attended places aka my school and my current church where ordination hasnt been an issue based on biblical arguments etc is it okay to have a dissenting voice on a topic like that as a convert i mean id concede to the church on her teachings but it doesnt mean id be happy about it lol a completely different but related topic can anyone be certain of their vocation in life before taking vows whether marriage or evangelical if so how thank you in advance and god bless all of yall this new year,1,kots4q

can a layperson bless another person ive been getting some mixed answers on this i remember when i did rcia i learnt that we could bless another person by making the sign of the cross on their forehead with the understanding that we werent actually blessing them but asking god to bless them i also recall this happening in a formal setting a few times blessing children who were going to be baptised adults in rcia etc similarly during mass the eucharistic ministers will make the sign of the cross over those who cant receive communion to bless them however i was researching this earlier and i kept coming across a few statements that lay people can only bless themselves that lay people can only bless their own children and i suppose godchildren that when blessing someone or something lay people should only make the sign of the cross over themselves and not the person or object so can anyone help with this can lay people bless others with the understanding that we werent actually blessing them but asking god to bless them when we do this can we make the sign of the cross on their forehead,1,kq57se

thinking about the state of the liturgy and sacred architecture lately for context i just recently watched this video about the christianization of kievan rus it is said that in ad vladimir of kiev sent envoys to the volga bulgars who were muslim to the germans who were of the roman rite and to the greeks who were of the byzantine rite to learn more about their religions so he could choose which of them he might convert to the envoys came back with this report recorded in the primary chronicle when we journeyed among the bulgars we beheld how they worship in their temple called a mosque while they stand ungirt the bulgarian bows sits down looks hither and thither like one possessed and there is no happiness among them but instead only sorrow and a dreadful stench their religion is not good then we went among the germans and saw them performing many ceremonies in their temples but we beheld no glory there then we went on to greece and the greeks led us to the edifices where they worship their god and we knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth for on earth there is no such splendor or such beauty and we are at a loss how to describe it we know only that god dwells there among men and their service is fairer than the ceremonies of other nations those words stuck with me especially as we all know how this story ends vladimir converts to eastern christianity marrying the sister of emperor basil ii and i cannot help but wonder if the envoys walked into a modern church of the roman rite would they still pass the same judgment so many of our churches in the west look positively spartan in comparison with the solomonic lavishness of those of our eastern brethren they said they beheld no glory in the western liturgies all those centuries before is it still so today can we imagine ourselves as outsiders looking upon the mass and not knowing whether we were in heaven or on earth can we honestly say that there is a sense of god dwelling there among men these are mere externals yes we cannot deny that even if aesthetically impoverished our church still exhausts itself in countless charitable operations but my wayward eyes turn eastward and i cannot help but think why do we not offer god the splendor they do in our churches in our liturgy is this the best we have,1,kpsi1i
to transfer or not to transfer that is the question whether tis nobler or not to celebrate the feast of epiphany on sunday or weekday epiphany is in a weird state shared by the feasts of the ascension and corpus christi in some jurisdictions the celebrations are transfered to the nearest sunday but in others they remain on the specific dates they are fixed on this is a mildly inconvenient state of affairs where one can cross jurisdictional boundaries and find the liturgical date different on either side depending on the transfer policy of the dioceses in question what do you folks think about the matter,1,krui2v

changes in canon law and sin i am a protestant who is thinking about converting to catholicism and really close to doing so but there are just a couple of things holding me back one of them is canon law and its relationship to sin i understand what canon law is and that the pope can change it as he likes i understand that it is meant to govern the church and it makes sense when it comes to things like determining how church business is conducted and the like but i am troubled by the fact that there are changes to canon law that have happened over time in which the restrictions on the laity have become loosened this does not bother me in and of itself but i am troubled by the idea that doing something that would have put you in a state of mortal sin years ago would not today for example the length of time you have to fast before taking communion my understanding is that years ago you had to fast after midnight until you took communion it is my understanding that this rule was changed to three hours of fasting and finally to one hour of fasting while this does not trouble me in and of itself i am troubled by the idea that there might be someone in hell right now because they ate something minutes before taking communion years ago while someone doing the exact same thing today would not be committing a sin it seems like there should be consistency as to what is a sin and what is not for example adultery was considered a mortal sin years ago years ago years ago years ago years ago and today if you committed adultery at anytime you would have been committing a sin but eating something a minutes before taking communion seems to be sinful depending on the time that you are alive the same problem seems to be found in how cremation was forbidden before the but is now allowed women and men used to have segregated seating women used to be required to wear veils in church i believe there used to be restrictions on married couples not having sex before taking communion as there still is with food and there used to be more stringent fasting requirements around easter as well so my question isnt really why can these rules be changed but rather why is it that one could have done the exact same thing as another person who was living in a different time period but one of them will be committing mortal sin by doing it while the other is not committing any sin at all,1,kokt0u

question from fr mike schmitzs bible in a year hello i am not a catholic but i have been listening to fr mike schmitzs bible in a year and am liking it a lot so far its given me a different perspective on things than id normally get in a protestant sermon i actually have a question about that though for the episode day noahs ark he talks about how in genesis adam has seth in his image and since adam is made in the image of god that means seth is as well then in genesis when it talks about the sons of god finding the daughters of man beautiful its talking about the line of seth intermarrying with the line of cains descendants this isnt something i had ever heard before because though my protestant tradition says that some people believe in the sethcain line theory what they themselves teach is that this verse and the verse about the nephilim refer to fallen angels who interbred with humanity is what fr mike schmitz said the standard catholic view or is what he said considered esoteric is what my protestant church claims about these verses wrong thank you,1,kqafn7

have i sinned or i am being scrupulous i am being tortured by something today i went to confess and i told everything to the priest but regarding one sin i didnt give all the details not because i wanted to make myself less guilty or because i wanted to avoid the confession but because i didnt want to go into a debate with the priest about the topic i just wanted the confession so i went to the point and i said what i done the sin in question was that a few weeks ago a discussion arised and i dont remember well if someone made a question about the ot or the question aroused from the conversation the thing is that i said something but i realized after that i wasnt very sure about what i said so i might have given false information to the people listening and i might have given a wrong impression or lead them stray it was better for me to shut my mouth instead and what i said to the priest was that i anwser a question about the bible but i wasnt sure of the answer so it was better to keep quiet instead then the priest told me what was the question and i told him the topic i said moses but i just remember that it was about noah i tend to mix both stories for some reason sometimes honest mistake there i didnt wanted to lie i legit confused them both so when i was doing my penance for some reason i started thinking that since i didnt give all the details my confession wasnt valid i dont know i think it was valid i confessed what i did wrong speaking without knowing and potentially leading people stray i avoided to give details about the conversation because i didnt want a debate to arise in the confession maybe i used a poor wording to confess my sin but i didnt wanted to avoid the confession what do you guys think should i confess everything again or am i nuts,1,koz3c3

what would be the best means of distinguishing between inherent needs and sinful excess i have an extreme need to be recognised for what distinguishes me from others the reasons behind this include identity issues and loneliness in my early years people tended to ignore me more often than not and never preferred me to other friends topped with bullying at school i fear obscurity and mediocrity others being praised for their distinctiveness above me its not necessarily that i seek high status but mainly a place in the world among my fellow man everyone else is recognised for their distinctive traits even the generic blob though i fear becoming one as well i am highly philosophical and tend to make insightful comments at every opportunity i like to dress fancy speak in an oldfashioned way essentially portray myself as a quaint and somewhat mad scholar not for the sake of praise logically i dont know why i would do it for praise when i could easily do many other things for praise as much as i like the style want to embody the glory of the past and want it to be my thing i dont consider it to be an affectation though i exaggerate certain thing sometimes to get a reaction out of others im fine so long as theres a specific thing that distinguishes me yet apparently part of vainglory is behaving eccentrically in order to get attention i also have a fear of abandonment that plays into it as though everyone will abandon me if im not interesting which logically probably isnt true even if i were to quit trying to distinguish myself stop talking about some of the cool things i do which might be bragging though again i just want to be seen as a distinctive human being and become a generic blob i wouldnt be satisfied because my nature isnt a generic blob if that makes sense i fear the same loneliness and obscurity in my childhood or again if i were to quit trying to distinguish myself to fade into nothingness seeing as every action and word of mine carries with it that intention to some degree i dont know how i would live otherwise even as a child at school i made myself out to be a clown to get a reaction out of others also i enjoy being praised though sometimes i enjoy being insulted as well because it requires special interest to hate someone i had a somewhat bad childhood so i think thats natural unless im lying about how bad it truly was and looking for an excuse some things i dont enjoy my friends praising me for i enjoy my family doing it for because it proves im not a stupid failure to some degree i have a superiority complex in some respects but an inferiority complex in many others hence the constant compensation i do become envious when others are praised instead of me seeing as it feels as though all of my efforts are for nothing anyone can be a better me than me obviously all of this is quite trivial its just that every time i try to let it go i remember being ignored in my childhood or think that my friends wont want to be around me anymore for being a generic blob and tense up again i have trouble distinguishing how much of this is disordered and how much of it is natural and whether it matters or whether its a mortal or a venial sin i try to improve but sometimes fear i might be exaggerating what is natural and needlessly depriving myself of human needs i have also become concerned with the will of god as of recent i feel pushes to do or avoid a certain thing only to fear it might be scruples or alternatively me deluding myself into believing it is scruples so i have an excuse to sin i feel like its god calling me to do these things but as again cant be sure seeing as i just do what scruples tells me to lest i use going against my conscience as an excuse to sin or end up involuntarily sinning in the process i should note that i am also schizophrenic medication doesnt help much i am either too soft or too hard on myself either taking everything as condemnation or nearly sleeping on the road to hell i even feel guilty for enjoying snacks or basically anything else its also difficult to focus on anyone but myself considering i lack friends offline am mostly alone and fear my online friends abandoning or just not liking me as much anymore and have phobias that prevent me from going outside alone though working on that there are also legal and financial issues plus i am not a member of any church despite trying to live a good catholic life as anyone else havent been baptised again cant access psychiatric help due to said legal and financial issues so i am pretty much at a loss for what to do in regards to my mindset god bless sorry for the excessive text dont know how to condense it into a tldr due to being in a heightened state of anxiety and the smallest detail being important,1,krqjtr
jk huysmans is a great catholic writer and deserves any more attention than he gets jk huysmans was a frenchman who was raised catholic fell away for some time but had a reversion back to the faith when he saw the failures of materialistic atheism of his day he was born in the mid s and died in he wrote a fair amount but his truly catholic material came later starting with a rebours against nature in english a great little novel about how material pursuits are in the end meaningless i just started his book on st lydwine of scheidam and it seems very good as well unfortunately he sort of fell into obscurity only to be read and promoted by punk rockers who totally miss his message and misplace his pessimism regarding the world around us i recommend that the catholic community pick him up again and take a dive into the obscure french literature world he truly is a diamond in the rough,1,kqkxge

holy day of obligation please help me here last week i fell in a sin i am battling so i made an appointment to see a priest for confession which took place today he mentioned that we could meet after his holy day mass and we did not knowing what a holy day of obligation was i am a young returning catholic so i dont know a lot i googled it during my doordash shift only to find that you are supposed to treat it like a sunday no work this is very distressing and frustrating because i feel like i have mortally sinned literally an hour after confession i completed a few deliveries then ended my shift do i need to go to confession before my next mass or am i being too scrupulous had i known i would not have started the shift but i did continue the shift while contemplating this the obligation to attend mass is lifted in my area though due to the pandemic obviously i will need to pay attention to the dates for holy days of obligation in the future,1,koi613

how did simeon have the holy spirit before baptism in luke in luke it says that simeon was filled with the holy spirit and it instructed him to be there for the presentation of jesus at the temple how can this be when the holy spirit is only received after baptism with the exception of the apostles at pentecost i understand god is not bound to the sacraments like how he gave the apostles the spirit even though they were not baptized but how could god do this to simeon when original sin could not be forgiven until after christs sacrifice on the cross,1,kp3p9s
politics monday thoughts on liberation theology good bad neutral disclaimer this post does not endorse marxism or going against catholic teaching not every revolution is the french revolution the first mexican revolution and the filipino revolution were started by catholic priests the church has not officially condemned liberation theology radical forms that are marxist are condemned but the theology itself is not please be respectful as stated in my disclaimer liberation theology is not officially condemned there are some forms of it that involve marxism and those marxist forms are condemned but the theology in general is not condemned maybe its because i am american and raised to be antityranny and antimonarchy but i dont see how liberation theology and political revolutions to advance achieve freedom and equality for oppressed people is bad sure things like the haitian revolution went too far but the haitians for the most part were justified in rising up and breaking the shackles of their oppression condemning needlessly death and supporting the plight of marginalized people dont have to be mutually exclusive i think equating every revolution to the french revolution or the communist take over of albanian and other eastern countries is disingenuous so yea thoughts on liberation theology is it as bad as people say is there an alternative theology that oppressed people can subscribe to,1,kqeeup
some issues i face rejoining the church hi there i am i guess what you would call a lapsed catholic and sometimes identify as agnostic baptized grew up in catholic school for a few years which i think actually did more harm than good and really my family was only creaster catholics shortly thereafter anyways since about highschool noncatholic it was a charter school i became interested in catholicism again because i had a few christian teachers who both are roman catholic now that i found incredibly interesting as they were really knowledgeable about philosophyfilmhistory i also find biblical themes in art really compelling and have always been drawn to the beauty of the catholic church in addition i have a really good bible i bought recently nrsv lectio divina edition so now im in my late still debating confirmation i find myself every year thinking im going to go back to massconfessionarrange a meeting with a pastor but really the most ive done is go to mass twice the last year and attend a flannery oconner book club if that counts anyways i thought id share with you guys the constant doubts i run into these problems bug me so much that once i begin to find the answers i often find myself ending up right back where i started i dont expect any definitive answers to these questions but perhaps you guys could tell me how you worked through some of these same doubts or give me some pertinent reading suggestions philosophical problems primarily the existence of a god ive been satisfied with most arguments in favor of gods existence but the most formidable one for me and many others has been the problem of evil ive listened to summaries of aquinass answer to this issue but i have never been totally convinced one problem i have hearing most apologists talking about this problem is that their examples are like the holocaust or like human atrocities committed by other humans even on that note i cannot understand what unknown purpose a tragedy such as this would serve or how it can be simplified as a deprivation of good also sometimes when i think of evil i just think of very arbitrary misfortunes that i cannot see no good unknown to us or not coming out of ive heard an apologist say something on this topic such as oh like when i hit my thumb with hammer but i dont think of trivial stuff such as that but instead like a newborn being eaten by a coyote being born with a sexual deformity starvation etc in short when i think about the evil in the world i dont simply mean moral evils committed by humans and also how can people say that something was simply not part of gods plan if god is all knowing how can anything deviate from his plan when it comes to philosophy i really dont expect to completely reach god through reason i think some faith could be required but at the same time some philosophical problems bother me it seems that for every god argument for gods existence there is also an equally good argument against it im not really a philosophy buff but i also dont have the conviction alone to just believe i dont want to build my faith on a house of cards so to speak id like to at least have some confidence in these issues theological problems so lets say weve solved the problem of evil and im satisfied with the answer so which god ive been enamored with catholic thinkers artists filmmakers etc but surely thats not a good reason to just pick that one i also admire other cultures and find their respective religions interesting so who am i to say theyve got it wrong do you try to bridge the gap by finding similarities pick theirs apart or just coexist once you decide god exists why the one in the bible and when i pick up the bible and read it it doesnt seem like im reading about the omnipotent omnibenevolent and omniscient being that i read about in all these philosophical treatises but instead this paternal emotional almost personified being again i know that the bible is open to interpretation and i think i could be easily persuaded about how the god in the bible is in fact the god i read about in philosophy so this isnt such a nagging obstacle for me but a dilemma nonetheless spiritual problemskeeping the faith i think it is rather difficult to be catholic in america our cultural identity doesnt seem to be as strong here as some other places in the world such as some areas of latin america or rome obviously how can i coexist with the world perhaps the bible could be my guide on questions such as this how do you reconcile difficult social issues in todays world as well as be open to other cultures and ideas i worry about if i become catholic i will seclude myself and be constantly perceiving a threat where there may be none id rather not adopt a persecution complex and i want to be a good representative of the faith like all the people who influenced me to think differently about christianity feel free to just address one of these issues no need to go through them all i also apologize for the rambling thoughts and mispellings most likely but i struggle with this often to the point where i disengage and decide im just not going to think about christianity or religion for awhile ive considered just getting confirmed but im worried it wont be sincere if i do not have some basic closure with my beliefs if i even have them also i do like to read so if you guys just want to point me towards some sources for my questions that would be greatly appreciated i would also like to know if you struggled with the same problems and how you dealt with them,1,kpwqu9
be wary of antichristian groups blms primary purpose is not to help black lives but to bring about a communism society one of the cofounders said that she and another cofounder were trained marxists demonstrating just how far left they are another cofounder wrote an article on a venezuelan news website in which she called out bernie sanders for calling hugo chavez a dictator even worse susan rosenburg sits on the board of directors of blm susan has taken part in communist organizations in america and was arrested in and sentenced to years in prison on weapons and explosives charges she was also sought as an accomplice to a couple of bombings she is free now because her sentence was commuted by bill clinton the black lives matter website itself says that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family one of the stated goals found within the communist manifesto this alone shows just how little the group cares for black lives one of the most devastating things to have hit black america in the latter half of the century has been the destruction of the nuclear family single motherhood makes children much more likely to live in poverty and commit crimes not attacking single mothers but the trend is real over of africanamericans are born to single mothers this is the major problem facing the community black fathers have to begin caring for the women they impregnate and the children they bear who once abandoned by their fathers are forced into a life of poverty a nuclear family with a father in the home makes a boatload of difference prior to the mid nearly all children were born to married couples including black children this phenomenon was reversed once the progressive war on poverty began the welfare state incentivized single motherhood as it provided mothers with welfare benefits if there was no man in the house additionally the vast majority of africanamericans that are murdered in america are killed by other blacks this is not to say that we should ignore police brutality as that should be addressed as well police who commit murder against unarmed civilians should be punished and police reform should be enacted however the group is spreading the false narrative that police and racism are the most dangerous things facing black america this is false as mentioned previously the vast majority of africanamericans who are killed are killed by other blacks not whites we have seen this trend worsen with blms calls to defund the police democratrun cities that have surrendered to these proposals have seen skyrocketing crime rates including blackonblack crime there was an year old girl in atlanta who was shot by an armed blm protestor this is but one of many instances of the blackonblack violence that has plagued america despite this blm has not changed its stance on policing thus davis dorn an africanamerican who was protecting his friends pawn shop was killed by looters patrick underwood a black police officer was killed in oakland compare that to the number of unarmed blacks killed by cops most blacks that are killed by the police are actually armed selection more evidence that blms main goal is not helping blacks but overthrowing the us for a communist society is the fact that they have continuously defaced statues important to american history they have even defaced statues of abolitionists and union soldiers one of the main goals found in the communist manifesto is the destruction of the nuclear family religion and national identity in order to make way for a communist society this seems to be what blm is attempting why else would they deface the statue of antislavery poet greenleef whittier they also toppled the statue of a norwegian immigrant and abolitionist who served in the union army during the american civil war they defaced a statue of abraham lincoln in london and the colorado state capitol khachkar memorial to the armenian genocide as we see they are deliberately trying to destroy the memory of western civilization just as the communist manifesto calls for these arent isolated events rioters in philly deface a statue of matthias baldwin an early abolitionist who fought against slavery they vandalized the memorial to the victims of communism in dc as well as the dc statue of tadeusz kociuszko who fought for the rights of minorities in his will he donated a portion of his estate to free slaves belonging to thomas jefferson he also bequeathed sums for the education of freed slaves they also defaced the memorial to vietnam veterans many of whom were africanamericans a statue defaced with the acronym blm along with the communist hammer and sickle symbol furthermore the majority of interracial crimes in america are not committed by whites but by blacks the groups is spreading the narrative the africanamericans are overly policed however black men who make up around of the population commit over of the violent crimes i recommend you watch videos by thomas sowell larry elder and brandon tatum they are all africanamericans who give an alternative perspective to that given by blm activists violence and chaos caused by blm rhetoric blm refuses to disavow no leader or local chapter disavows david dorn a former black police officer was murdered for trying to protect his friends pawn shop from looters police officers in oakland one black were shot patrick underwood man kills police officer blm activists block road and shoot man trying to drive through a woman in ny state runs into a line of officers a colorado blm protestor blocking road shoots a disabled veteran in the head woman tries to run over a cop in philly antifa militant arrested for stabbing black trump supporter in portland blm activist calls for images of white jesus to be taken down a few days before that a statue of jesus was beheaded in fl a church statue of the virgin mary was then set on fire in boston other churches and religious statues have been desecrated following the blm activists calls cofounder of blm toronto called whites subhuman and genetically defective cofounder of blm vancouver says that reliability and loyalty are white supremacist concepts blm activist in chicago encourages looting calls it reparations biker in wisconsin attacked for being white armed blm protestor shoots at car and kills yearold black girl blm activist arrested for extorting business and threatening shop owner if he doesnt comply the demands that blm in louisville kentucky attempt to extract from local businesses armed black militia asks man for reparations rioters attacked the car of a year old man with cerebral palsy in columbus ohio childrens hospital attacked man in portland beaten unconscious its ironic that blm was founded by socalled antiracist marxists who perscribe to the gender philosophy blm activists continuously denounce the us for the flaws of its founding generation yet they themselves never seem to engage in the selfcriticism that they want americans to accept marx was a vehement racist and the gender ideology espoused by the blm organization was created by pedophiles a close look into the history of the black lives matter organization shows that its founders have close ties to communism dont just take it from conservative commentators listen to the words of cofounder patrisse cullors who in an interview admitted that she and cofounder alicia garza were both trained marxists in another interview with teen vogue cullors admitted to being mentored by angela davis they team up every year to give public speeches who is angela davis she is a political activist who ran twice as the vice president of the communist party of america in davis went on a trip to the ussr where she was given the lenin peace prize she expressed her gratitude for the prize bearing the name of vladimir ilyich lenin here on the very soil where he led the great october revolution when his party failed to garner substantial traction in its first election lenin and his bolsheviks disbanded the russian legislature lenin then implemented a series of purges hundreds of thousands were killed through his red terror and dekulakization campaigns the victims were targeted either because they were convicted of wrongthink or deemed privileged peasants kulaks this is the man that cullors mentor praised black lives matters association with communism does not end there the us social forum brands itself as an internationalist movement that seeks to transform america in one of the groups detroit meetings both patrice cullors and eric mann were chosen as panelists in eric mann became involved with the weather underground group a domestic terrorist group whose goal was world communism they wanted to create two three many vietnams through which the us would be defeated and destroyed in the process while america fought communism abroad they sought to destabilize the us from within the way they would achieve this goal was to create chaos and instability at home this is what led to eric manns imprisonment in he and his fellow weather underground comrades rioted at harvard where mann was arrested for assault and destroying property susan rosenburg a convicted terrorist served as vice chair on the board of directors for black lives matters fundraising organization thousand currents in the susan rosenberg took part in the may communist organization whose goal was to overthrow the us government through armed struggle and use of violence carrying out the organizations stated goals susan rosenberg was arrested in for possession of a huge amount of explosives and numerous weapons she had already been on the run for a number of years for her role in previous robberies and murders as serious as her crimes were she was released after bill clinton commuted her sentence in this same group was responsible for bombings at multiple locations between and including military installations the capitol and the new york patrolmens benevolent association demonstrating just how far left they are opal tometi cofounder of the black lives matter network wrote an article on a venezuelan news website in which she admonished bernie sanders for branding hugo chavez a dictator she also took a picture of herself alongside venezuelan dictator nicolas maduro for being an organization that claims to stand against police brutality opal had no qualms about embracing a dictator whose own police forces have murdered and tortured thousands of civilians the year before the picture was taken protestors were killed by the regime and the un documented over cases of torture in less than a year praise of communist dictators continues in black lives matter released a eulogy for fidel castro after his death castros regime had previously engaged in extrajudicial killings and torture he also persecuted christianity which most africanamericans adhere to communists and socialists escape all criticism no matter how egregious their crimes or how similar those crimes are to the perceived injustices they claim to fight against in the us an organization that embraces marxism and violent criminal regimes is not a group that america should embrace clues regarding the extent to which blm supports marxism are abound their own website references the word comrade multiple times and the raised fist that they have adopted onto their flag was first used by the communist party of germany it has been a popular symbol amongst communists ever since the black lives matter website itself states that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family one of the objectives found within the communist manifesto blm is marxist not only in theory but in practice as well the communist manifesto calls for the destruction of religion and national identity in order to make way for a communist society trained marxists around the world have sought to make good on this by destroying all evidence of the past especially statues and religious icons they have done so in maos cultural revolution as well as in cambodia under pol pot in this regard black lives matter is no different some supporters claim that blm has only destroyed confederate statues this is untrue as they have continuously defaced statues depicting abolitionist figures in american history they defaced the statue of antislavery poet greenleef whittier they toppled the wisconsin statue of a norwegian immigrant and abolitionist who served in the union army during the american civil war they defaced the colorado state capitol khachkar memorial to the armenian genocide rioters in philly defaced a statue of matthias baldwin an early abolitionist who fought against slavery blm vandalized the memorial to the victims of communism in dc and took pictures of themselves flipping off the statue they are deliberately trying to destroy the memory of western civilization just as the communist manifesto calls for ,1,kp7g29

do catholics spread a workbased gospel i of course dont think so but i encountered a comment on rchristianity that said that the catholic church is a false church because they spread a work based gospel they even quoted a bunch of bible verses that said we are saved by grace alone isnt that what the catholic church preaches but they didnt have any evidence against catholicism i always thought that the catholic church taught that we are saved by grace but that our actions works should reflect that and glorify god am i wrong in my understanding of the gospel,1,kpyd2n

nervous about converting to catholicism im currently a nondenominational christian who was raised evangelicalpenetecostal ive never really had a problem with my faith until recently ive started questioning the credibility of my church i was raised in the foursquare church for a few reasons they are obviously protestant and i dont really understand why they branched off of the catholic church in my mind the catholic church is the closest church to what jesus wanted and i guess i dont understand why they strayed from that i also dislike the lack of legitimate history of my church ive been looking into catholicism and i think im being called to convert but im a bit nervous about how this will be perceived by my family theyre mostly evangelicalpenetecostal lutheran mormon or atheist and most of them dislike catholics for the reasons most protestants do they think catholics worship mary and the other saints and they think that having rules is a bad thing i really like how structured the catholic church is theyre also hesitant about confession because they think it means that priests can forgive our sins instead of god theres only one catholic in my family and thats my dad i know he would be totally supportive of me wanting to convert but the rest of my family would be a lot more hesitant and concerned does anyone have any advice,1,kqx5xg

is the nrsvce fairaccurate in its extensive use of genderneutral language hello i would like to read a catholicapproved version of the bible that uses the most accurateupdated manuscripts such as the dead sea scrolls i have consistently read that the new revised standard version is one of the most accurate and is often used in academic settings it is well known that the nrsv as well as many other modern translations make extensive use of genderneutral language when the underlying text is ambiguous as to gender i have no problem with genderneutral language as long is it is an accurate and fair representation of the original text but i do not want genderneutral language to be used when the original text does not call for it or the translator wants to convey their particular viewpoint is the nrsvs use of genderneutral language fair and accurate or does it excessively reflect the translators viewpoints alternatively are there any more accurate translations that use the most updated biblical sources that you would recommend thanks and god bless,1,kp3dsv

sabbath correct me if im wrong but my understanding is that the mosaic law was broken down into parts moral ceremonial and judicial we now only have to follow the first kind a classic example would be the commandments however honoring the sabbath seems to be a ceremonial law instead of a moral one it also seems to be the only commandment that was done away with romans so why was it included with the others,1,koefxy

suicide vs sacrifice usually the answer to that question is that sacrifice is selfless and suicide is selfish in sacrifice unlike suicide you are not the one who kills yourself directly but that doesnt answer why it is immoral for example to donate an organ if it will kill you donating an organ is an unselfish act and it is the doctors who kill you not you directly ccc moreover it is not morally admissible to bring about the disabling mutilation or death of a human being even in order to delay the death of other persons so i dont really understand the difference between the sin of suicide and the noble act of sacrifice,1,krl2ow
doubt movie i wanted to show the wife calvary and she wanted to show me doubt so we watched doubt lol doubt was a fantastic movie and its a great look as to why the church is in the shit today instead of investigating firing and calling the secular authorities the predators in cloth were just transfered to become someone elses problem when one or two courageous people stood up to the wolf with that said i do also have sine frustration movies news media and pop culture always focus on organizations they dont really like such as the church and the boy scouts while a light is never shined on their sacred cows such as certain other religions and public schools where the rates of abuse are much much higher maybe the church is held to a higher standard but i would be naieve if i thought that was their motivation either way i think the motivation behind making the movie was to showcase the courageous nun and not to demean the church i hope im right,1,kpcq31

i think my family members are unknowingly committing sacrilege hey everyone so i have known for quite some time that missing sunday mass or a holy day of obligation is a mortal sin i also know that if you miss a sunday or holy day then you have to go to confession first in order to receive the eucharist in a state of grace well i know for a fact that some of my family members have missed sunday masses without going to confession and still received the eucharist at the next mass they go to i dont think they know what they are doing is wrong could someone give me some advice on how to tell them mass is in a few hours and when they receive the eucharist i will feel responsible for the sacrilege ,1,kpu73u

did angels appear to saints and if so were they ever seen as female i ask this because i recently ran across a story on youtube that was a claim from a young man who said that he had been in an automobile accident and he felt a touch on his forehead the spiritual touch and when he opened his eyes there was a woman i originally thought it was the blessed mother however he said that she had red hair and she acted in a way that ive never heard an angel act she told him that the dam i once was on his way now assuming the story is true which it probably is not i am wondering if the angel that appeared to the young man was actually a fallen angel a trick from the devil to convince him that the path he is chosen is the correct one he survived only by the grace of god however the devils interference confused him in to believing that he was on the right path the stirred up a thought did angels ever appeared to a saint i know the angels guided the saints but im not aware of an actual vision be it male or female im also wondering since angels are androgynous is it possible that the angel appeared to the man in the form he needed to see my only caveat is that the message from the angels was not a warning to repent it was to tell him that an ambulance is on its way angels dont do that do they lastly the man makes scary videos about the paranormal gee whiz i think im answering my own questions sorry if this wasted your time god bless you all,1,ko8fvc

i am a muslim that attended a catholic school in ontario just wanted to share my experience my parents wanted to send me to a catholic school because they thought public schools will not teach me religious values i attended it for four years went to mass and had religion class going in i knew nothing about catholics and i had many misconceptions i learned so much valuable knowledge and information at catholic school that i literally feel like theres a catholic inside of me now i consider them a family of sort some religion teachers clearly did not care much about what they taught but one in particular was so memorable i will never forget all that he taught me and all our class discussions he really opened my mind taught me so much about catholicism but i even started learning more about my own faith in a world where division and hatred are so common i am so happy to have been treated with respect and love by most of my teachers and others that worked at the school it wasnt what they taught but it was the way they behaved and conducted themselves with respect and thoughtfulness that really gave me such a good impression of the catholic faith now when i hear things such as catholics worship mary and all these other misconceptions i immediately and almost subconsciously find myself jumping to their defence passing on what ive learned it was a time in my life that i will never forget and a community that has a special place in my heart peace and love to you all side note unimportant confession mass was always held before lunch and i would be hungry i always thought about just saying im catholic so i could eat the bread we had to cross our arms on our chest during mass so the priest knows were not catholic and then he just blesses us,1,kp7j9h

can someone give me a wellrounded answer to something known as prayer paradox i would firstly like to add that i am a very devout christian but of course knowing everything is impossible but this is something i wish to learn and understand lately ive had several atheists ask me about something called the paradox of prayers it goes as follows an event in life is currently happening ie a very sick family member there are two possible routes here either they will get better or they can pass away now we as religious people would pray for our family member to be better god has a plan either it is for them to get better or that they have completed their role on earth and they will pass away if god has already planned for that person to live and get better isnt prayer for their wellbeing technically futile if god has already planned for their passing isnt praying for their wellbeing again futile if gods plan is perfect would he change his perfect plan for us would that mean that the plan isnt perfect i have heard the explanation that god being all knowing knew that we were going to pray and hence his plan was according to that i have also heard another explanation that gods plan is for mankind as a whole and not for specific individuals for individuals its our free will that decides what happens to us if anyone could further explain these two concepts or even explain the prayer paradox with another concept it would be greatly appreciated thank you in advance,1,kq9j84

you see everything it all breaks down in front of you the essence the air itself a complex design pulled into the void you gain momentum locked forward only slowing to what seems a lone star this must be the nexus i stared at it with no concept of time watching everything and nothing at some point i realized or be it recognized that this was the begining everything needed to start a new universe lay before me in this star within the star i could see the infinite possibilities the raw material that would be the foundation for the new universe i placed my hands within the star and began to create the universe i crafted galaxies and designed planets i encoded the laws of existence i generated the dna sequences of all life that would exists i had become the artificer that i was told i would be a near infinity of time passed before only one touch remained the energy needed to set the universe into motion so with one final push i began to push myself inside of the universe as a final gift to myself i decided that my parting words would serve as the first words of the new universe turns out the world doesnt end with a whimper after all it ends with one big bang,1,kp9kv6

i pray to god and had a very intense clear message that came to me but i dont know if it came from god or not it told me how i should stop watching testimony videos from new agers to christianity how me watching it would invite this particular spirit i had to come back againfeeling very scared hi so i pray this pray i found on youtube called prayer to jesus and apostles for urgent needs the pray link is here on youtubepray here i had this very clear message in my head out of no where saying this pray ive said this pray before in the past but never encountered a clear message like this so i thought to ask you to see if its from god or not in the pray i asked forhelp with my sin and my fear also me to get my frist holy sacraments as this was happening and i was praying the our father and hail mary an idea or a thought came into my mind but it said to me looking at the youtube videos of testimony about people going from new age to christianity and people warning this and that of new age and how some of those practice have been practicing in christian churches its best not to look at it as it feeds into my fear and how i was set free from the spirit but if i keep looking at it then it would open the wound for the spirit to come in this of course scared me because im thinking i dont want to invite that spirit again i then realised looking into the past how the sin started as i was young teenager and show me the pattern of my behavior and how the spirit lead me to sin meaning i would look at ghost demon stories or ghost hunting videos on the internet and then i would get scared and to emotional regulate myself i would committed this sin which looking at demonsghost feeds into the spirit so im wondering does this come from god or not,1,kpxkod

the anthropomorphic god of the old testament yes i had to google how to spell anthropomorphic im following along with fr mike schmitz bible in a year podcast i love the old testament stories but i struggle with how anthropomorphic god is presented there i come from a mormon background and mormons teach that god is a human with an actual body it was very eyeopening to move to a classical theist understanding of god but when i read the old testament it makes sense why mormons came to believe god is an exalted human hes depicted walking around the garden talking to people holding court in heaven job appearing to abraham hed need some form to appear right it seems clear that the early old testament often depicted god in this way why was their conception of god more anthropomorphic how do we square this depiction with the idea that god is immaterial being itself without parts etc how are we to understand these passages,1,krpwk9

response to ratheism post we shouldnt be trying to convert atheists online agree or disagree i thought of writing this in rchristianity but i realize we may have theological differences operating here so as a catholic familiar with catholicism i decided to post this here recently an ratheism thread made it to popular requesting that christians stop trying to convert them on their sub i agree with them but others may have a different take im and what life has taught me is the number one principle god definitely reaches everyone he can ie no soul is lost when it comes to atheists especially online you dont know the sins they have committed actively commit and whether they can or will repent to stop committing them again in general when arguing for a cause people put their best face first on the net to withstand public scrutiny this doesnt mean their life reflects it just that it is a tool of persuasion so again any argument with an atheist will assume they are on the high ground and we christians are arguing from a disadvantage again this is different from real life where you can see atheists commit all kinds of grievous sins on the media and in your personal life again given the choice to be in a dark ally with an atheist or a christian i would choose the christian this is just based on my life experience where christians have been good to me and atheists not so much this leads to the next point you cant argue experience the post on ratheism testifies to their experience again i cant argue with them about what they have gone through however neither can he argue with my experience with the faith and the holy spirit so because so much of our faith is an active living breathing experience there is nothing that can be argued we experience it and live it just as they dont experience and dont live it again going back to the original principle god definitely reaches everyone he can so pray and give it up to gods will what you can do and i actively do this you can pray for them never minimize prayer as advocacy if they are a good person with repentance to sin prayers will reach them and faith will enter their life otherwise there is nothing to argue with them such as trying to convert them finally there is something i term the atheists lament where atheists argue how could we be happy in heaven if atheists end up in hell once again through reflection and meditation and faith ive come to accept life is a precious gift and we are lucky to experience it it is also a very serious endeavor where people are asked to make choices about what they want to do with that gift and for eternity while i could live forever so many atheists testify they could not live forever so they are getting what they want by living how they are living they are entitled to that gift it doesnt mean i want the same path the very fact i am a christian means i want more and god expects more from me than an atheist so sticking to the principle god definitely reaches everyone he canwe all made decisions we are all responsible for our actionsi choose god i cant do anything about anyone who doesnt choose god that is their choice and i respect it they can respect mine as well but they have no imperative to respect anything because again there is no higher authority for them to answer to and agree or disagree,1,kp6c25

why is mental prayer so little mentioned im raised catholic and didnt learn about mental prayer until or so yet the saints tell us it is absolutely indispensable to the christian heres what st alphonsus ligouri doctor of the church says all the saints have become saints by mental prayer mental prayer is the blessed furnace in which souls are inflamed with the divine love in my meditation says david a fire shall flame out ps st vincent of paul used to say that it would be a miracle if a sinner who attends the sermons in the mission or in the spiritual exercises were not converted now he who preaches and speaks in the exercises is only a man but it is god himself that speaks to the soul in meditation i will lead her into the wilderness and i will speak to her heart hosea st catherine of bologna used to say he who does not practice mental prayer deprives himself of the bond that unites the soul with god hence finding her alone the devil will easily make her his own how she would say can i conceive that the love of god is found in the soul that cares but little to treat with god in prayer where but in meditation have the saints been inflamed with divine love by means of mental prayer st peter of alcantara was inflamed to such a degree that in order to cool himself he ran into a frozen pool and the frozen water began to boil like water in a caldron placed on the fire in mental prayer st philip neri became inflamed and trembled so that he shook the entire room in mental prayer st aloysius gonzaga was so inflamed with divine ardor that his very face appeared to be on fire and his heart beat as strongly as if it wished to fly from the body st laurence justinian says by the efficacy of mental prayer temptation is banished sadness is driven away lost virtue is restored fervor which has grown cold is excited and the lovely flame of divine love is augmented hence st aloysius gonzaga has justly said that he who does not make much mental prayer will never attain a high degree of perfection a man of prayer says david is like a tree planted near the current of waters which brings forth fruit in due time all his actions prosper before god blessed is the man who shall meditate on his law day and night and he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters which shall bring forth its fruit in due season and his leaf shall not fall off and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper ps mark the words in due season that is at the time when he ought to bear such a pain such an affront etc st john chrysostom compared mental prayer to a fountain in the middle of a garden oh what an abundance of flowers and verdant plants do we see in the garden which is always refreshed with water from the fountain such precisely is the soul that practices mental prayer you will see that it always advances in good desires and that it always brings forth more abundant fruits of virtue whence does the soul receive so many blessings from meditation by which it is continually irrigated thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard the fountain of gardens the well of living waters which run with a strong stream from ubanus song of songs but let the fountain cease to water the garden and behold the flowers plants and all instantly wither away and why because the water has failed you will see that as long as such a person makes mental prayer he is modest humble devout and mortified in all things but let him omit meditation and you will instantly find him wanting in modesty of the eyes proud resenting every word indevout no longer frequenting the sacraments and the church you will find him attached to vanity to useless conversations to pastimes and to earthly pleasures and why the water has failed and therefore fervor has ceased my soul is as earth without water unto thee my spirit hath fainted away ps the soul has neglected mental prayer the garden is therefore dried up and the miserable soul does from bad to worse when a soul abandons meditation st chrysostom regards it not only as sick but as dead he says the holy doctor who prays not to god nor desires to enjoy assiduously his divine conversation is dead the death of a soul is not to be prostrated before god the same father says that mental prayer is the root of the fruitful vine and st john climacus writes that prayer is a bulwark against the assault of afflictions the spring of virtues the procurer of graces rufinus asserts that all the spiritual progress of the soul flows from mental prayer and gerson goes so far as to say that he who neglects meditation cannot without a miracle lead the life of a christian speaking of mental prayer jeremias says he shall sit solitary and hold his peace because he hath taken it up upon himself lam that is a soul cannot have a relish for god unless it withdraws from creatures and sits that is stops to contemplate the goodness the love the amiableness of god but when solitary and recollected in meditation that is when it takes away its thoughts from the worldit is then raised above itself and departs from prayer very different from what it was when it began it st ignatius of loyola used to say that mental prayer is the short way to attain perfection in a word he who advances most in meditation makes the greatest progress in perfection in mental prayer the soul is filled with holy thoughts with holy affections desires and holy resolutions and with love for god there man sacrifices his passions his appetites his earthly attachments and all the interests of selflove moreover by praying for them in mental prayer we can save many sinners as was done by st teresa st mary magdalene de pazzi and is done by all souls enamored of god who never omit in their meditations to recommend to him all infidels heretics and all poor sinners begging him also to give zeal to priests who work in his vineyard that they may convert his enemies in mental prayer we can also by the sole desire of performing them gain the merit of many good works which we do not perform for as the lord punishes bad desires so on the other hand he rewards all our good desires st teresa avila writes in the interior castle of levels of prayer and yet mental prayer also called meditation starts at level vocal prayer being the lowest its worth noting that ascending this ladder of prayer corresponds directly to ascending in virtue levels and how many people reach the second both st teresa and st alphonsus say point blank that without minutes per day mental prayer it is impossible to avoid mortal sin but how many of you have actually heard about it i didnt learn of it until i spent time on the trad part of youtube never heard a sermon on it never discussed it in religion classes at catholic school and all the books that seem to cover it are from centuries ago how can it be that something so absolutely crucial to our salvation is hardly ever mentioned especially among laity no wonder only of catholics believe in the real presence no wonder so many people apostatize things are probably only as good as they are because of the cloistered monastics engaged in contemplation and even mystical prayer every day around the world without that wed probably have faced a nuclear holocaust by now thank god for the rosary since that may be the only way countless people just happen to stumble upon meditation i hope every person reading this at least has their curiosity piqued and learns more of this kind of prayer we need it everyone can do it not just clerics and religious some additional online reading can be found here and here,1,kp94g6
 questions im asking as someone between protestantism and rc whether proneness to sin itself deserves punishment whether works apart from the law are works apart from the ceremonial law only or apart from all of the moral law whether jesus bore our sins on the cross as punishment whether atonement is solely the cause for rejoicing in the removal of our burdensome guilt for past sins or whether it is cause for rejoicing in the nearness of god such that our past transgressions are seen even by us with our new eyes and forgiven by us as by god whether the order of salvation is such that we receive the holy spirit who justifies us because we have heard and believed or that we hear and believe because we received the holy spirit who justified us whether the life death and resurrection of jesus christ are intrinsically tied to the means of our sanctification or if the latter is to be considered as an entirely separate process appended to and coming on the heels of justification whether the gospel message conveyed by christianity is a message that itself changes us when heard by us a message of our having changed or a message of the possibility of future change,1,komv23

future conversion causing tension with my father in preparation for my wedding maybe with my mother too i was born and raised in the mormon faith baptized as is typical at the age of i stopped going to church when i was or so for a few reasons being disturbed by a number of doctrinal teachings the humaninspired book of mormon experiencing blatant misogyny from my peers being overly sexualized by church leadership forced confessions for sexual sins shunningshaming being par for the course you get the picture now at im happy to say that since my engagement to my fianc a cradle catholic in october i have felt intensely drawn to the catholic church so much do that i have since resolved to start rcia and hopefully become baptized in august my fianc and i originally planned to marry in october but decided yesterday to marry this october in a catholic church with only those nearest and dearest to us and repurpose the event next year to be more of a receptionreally grand anniversary party with the rest of our family and friends everyone including my parents expressed tremendous joy approval of our decision well until my dad asked me if i had to be baptized as a catholic to marry in a catholic church i told him i didnt but that i wanted to be i heard him say okay and then kind of mumble something along the lines of think about it i texted my mother that i felt he didnt seem happy about my conversion and she hasnt responded to me yet i feel like theyre discussing it amongst themselves you see they were both converted to mormonism from catholicism my mothers parents converted when she was and my father converted in his while dating my mothertrust me i dont miss the irony have any of you been in a similar situation i kind of wish my parents would just be happy that i want to have a relationship with god again i know i can never turn away from him again and i know i will never return to mormonism but how do i communicate that without ruining my relationship with my parents and ruining whats supposed to be a joyous time,1,kraf0n

need to vent about nfp and other things from a noncatholic i am a noncatholic who is about to marry a catholic i have been taking the required courses for my fiancee and his family they are very understanding and are not expecting me to convert or anything i never planned to and this process has just made that statement feel more true than ever before i need to vent about some things and maybe seek some advice from the other side i am required to take this nfp course and i hate it i hate that they dont give you a choice and that only i have to take it not my fiancee we went to our meeting with the deacon in charge of our process and were lectured about how we dont plan to force catholicism on our children they have zero regard to my feelings or my raising and only care that i conform to theirs because my fiancee was raised catholic my fiancee doesnt even agree with of what they want us to do neither do his parents but they want our marriage recognized by the church so i am being forced to do all this i would be lying if i didnt say i was building a bit of resentment towards everyone i think nfp is fine if it is your choice but it should not be forced on me from what i have been told most catholics dont even do it the catholic church has been so unaccepting of me and so unkind in all of this i have not once felt welcomed or truly talked to about why they feel the way they feel its just because they tried to push me to get baptized in the church before our wedding and i said no because why would i want to get baptized into a church that has been nothing short of awful to me during my entire engagement and even before that i am a christian but i have zero desire to be a part of the catholic church and honestly dont want my kids to be a part of it either i have stated all this to my fiancee already and he understands why he is very angry with the church for how they have treated me and for other things hiding the rape of countless children i am not one to bash religions but i needed to vent because i feel so forced into something i dont believe and it is hard to stay motivated when you feel so discouraged i have been biting my tongue through this entire thing but i am tearing up as i write this because i dont want to let my fiancee or his family down but i dont know if i can continue to do this for another months thanks for reading if you made it this far tldr catholic church has been awful to me but wants to me convert and i am required to take all these courses i dont agree with dont want to let down fiancee or inlaws but dont know if i can keep this up another months,1,krrepk

are women allowed to preside over a eucharistic service when a priest is absent i was attending church this morning in a smaller rural town and the mass began with a woman dressed in robes and vestments explaining that the parishs normal priest was not available and that the following service would be a service celebrated in the absence of a priest the woman then began the service blessed us and was making gestures and movements quite similar to that of a priest i was not sure if this was allowed especially given the fact that she was dressed in the garments of clergy and her various gestures including the laying on of hands any insight would be greatly appreciated,1,kpo3zs
my questions about monks and nuns hello i am doing a research about monks and nuns i searched on google for a while but later thought it might be helpful to ask my questions here too for the most helpful answers to my questions and the following questions came to mind during my research what is the definition of a monk and a nun what are the activities of a monk and a nun what are the main objectives of a monk and a nun and i hope you have the time to provide me with a comprehensive answer,1,kq79ks
grandmas dream before covid hit my grandmum was a eucharistic minister at the church she went to in her dream there was a little chapel and a big church she wanted to celebrate mass in the big church but was pushed into the little chapel instead while distributing communion it was her turn to receive jesus but the priest had unfortunately run out of hosts the alter server went to get more but they was only one little piece left she was able to receive the last communion but saw two others waiting to receive she thought if she received holy communion the two others waiting beside her wouldnt be able to receive holy communion so she broke off a little piece for one person but kept the larger piece of jesus to herself the person got a little piece and the person had none in the end of her dream she woke up feeling tremendous guilt and sadness and thought she acted selfishly she could have broke off more of her communion to give to the person but she ended up keeping more of jesus to herself i felt this dream had a valuable lesson to be learnt once we receive jesus we are given the bread from heaven having all sweetness in it this should in turn also give us a desire to go share this blessing with others but spiritual greed sometimes gets in the way and we forget that our neighbour also needs jesus very much basically when we want jesus and heaven for ourselves more than we want it for others its selfish desiring heaven for ourselves is a good thing but desiring it for others as jesus does is even better go preach the gospel,1,kq299k

afraid to put my trust in god and need help i was raised southern evangelical baptist the typical god causes hurricanes and god allows mass shootings in schools because they they took down an in god we trust sign if something bad happens to you then its because you sinned someone dies and its gods will or god only gives you trials you can handle so now i have this fear that if i fully trust god if i fully put my trust in him that he will allow something horrible to happen in my life to test me that hell cause something bad to happen but call it good that he will put something horrible in my path to teach me something thatll ill say ok god i trust in you and boom cancer diagnosis the next day to teach me the value of today or something ive been a catholic for a couple years but im having a very hard time shaking that mindset i know deep down its not true i know god is not responsible for the evils of the world i know this fear is irrational but its there and im struggling i still dont know who or what god truly is i feel guilty for thinking that i know how deeply god loves us all i know all he wants is for me to love him back its horrible that i dont trust him anyone have any advice or maybe some literature that can help me understand better ive gone to my priest but he tells me that the heart is a muscle and needs training so keep praying i need something more substantial than that,1,kq11w3
am i even catholic new christian trying to find where i belong in this gigantic confusing family originally i thought i was catholic but i dont know anymore ive been attending online mass for the past month or so and read the wordpray multiple times a day here are my problems unlike protestants i believe in the real blood and body of christ not a symbol after doing some research ive found no reason to believe that the books that protestants took out arent scripture i dont want to pray to mary saints it was jesus christ who saved me from my life of sin and ive felt nothing but love through praying to god and i dont see any biblical evidence to praying to a human and asking her for her intercession ive been doing amazing with god and god alone again unlike protestants i take all scripture into account and in scripture it says that all generations shall call mary blessed so i will honor and call her blessed and not bash her like protestants seem to love doing i believe in the forgiveness of sin through the shed blood of christ ive talked to some people on here and they seem to rely on confessions to a priest for forgiveness i dont believe in that i dont know where i belong i dont feel protestant however i dont feel catholic,1,ko3vli

childhood trauma priest got angry at me because it was my first confession ive been meditating lately about the reasons for my early separation from the catholic faith among some other important reasons i think the first bad experience i had was during my first confession the local priest an old polish guy was known to be pretty difficult to deal with he used to slap kids in the face when they didnt answer his questions the way he wanted i was about years old when i went to make my confession but as soon as he learned this little fact he went ballistic calling me names out loud for the whole place to hear i got out of the church crying mostly because the priest was an ahole but in part because i really wanted to confess the thing is after that episode i never considered confessing again and that played a big part in my distrust for priests and religion as a whole has this happened to anyone and if so how did you deal with it,1,kq1ael

in confession what if i know i committed a particular sin but cannot exactly remember what it was i just read some answers in catholic forums saying that all lying is a mortal sin despite causing no evil and even st augustine and st thomas aquinas condemn all forms of falsehood i have lied many times unfortunately i cannot remember what they were mainly because they were nothing serioussuch as to cause harm although ill perform an examination of conscience but mainly for the purpose of self preservation or to maintain the secrets entrusted to me my questions are so since i committed these lies yet i cant remember what i lied about can i just tell the priest i have been lying but cant remember what the lies were specifically about will i still get absolution what if i remember committing a sin but i can not remember what it specifically was can i just say father i committed a sin but i cant remember what it was currently and still get absolution also in one post someone said that not all lies are mortal sins and provided an article from the catechismnot sure if it was exactly from the catechism or if the original user really said that this aint a lie right so i am really confused thanks for reading,1,kp1k8k
is it sinful to have a personal opinion didferent from the bible but still follow the bible i just recently read about heresy as being a denial of the truth shown to us by god or something like that in the catechism i was wondering if having a different personal opinion that opposes christian doctrine but still follow it is a sin for example not participating in premarital sex because god forbids it but having a personal opinion that approves of premarital sexbut still not doing it out of faith thanks,1,kr6rod
what types of mortification have you done and how has it helped you im going through a path of mortification that started lately after i stopped being a lazy brat ive been mortifying vanity pride and judgement with well silence as well as the different feelings i got from worldly songs that enticed anger pride sexuality curse words etc its been helpful and is constructing a lot on my spiritual journey and adding to my peace in everyday life even though its constant work i do feel like doing has been too easy and maybe not enough since its easy but i know that another types of mortification are not recommended before a solid and mature spiritual life and that you should have an spiritual guide for that i also feel like this may be vanity from my side soo a wanted to talk to fellow catholics about it how has been your journey on this subject ,1,kruan6

currently panicking so when you remember a forgotten mortal sin or what you think is mortal youre under the obligation to confess it per canon law i get this i used to do this perfectly until my scrupulosity became so crippling it almost ruined me when i would confess the past and remembered sins id do it a thousand times under a hundred words my confessor finally caught on and twice commanded me not to dig the past or reconfess things this has made my life easier in ways i cant articulate but other posters have brought this up so when id go to confession the ocd or scruples would arise hey remember that time or hey this one time or another moment i was told explicit and unwavering obedience to the confessor is key to be healed and key to peace ive obeyed every single time ive been taught that the confessor applies the churchs moral law to the individual penitent so being commanded not confess the past or reconfess sins is the correct way to go about from now on may i continue to do so with my confessions only confess sins since the last sacramental absolution and i posted this to the priest sub and was given a different answer then what other priests have given how many sacrilegious communions and confessions have i made im dangerously close to a panic attack at the moment how much left do i have to confess,1,kpdu7h

selflessness selfcenteredness and mental illness hi catholic reddit tldr trying to reconcile my weakness and selfcenteredness often caused by onandoff anxietydepression with my desire to get rid of real sinful selfcentered patterns and be a more selfless person ive been doing a week prayer challenge based in ignatian spirituality the past month or two the challenge and accompanying spiritual exercises are highly focused on determining patterns of selflessness and selfcenteredness in your life and combating them with prayer etc its been eyeopening so far and overall a positive spiritual experience but ive had some cognitive difficulties ive struggled with some moderate anxiety and depression the past year or two no diagnosis working actively to fight it with good physical habits talking to others and prayer but looking into medical causes and willing to try medication if it ever gets too bad to handle often i am fine but during the worst episodes i find myself doing normal depressionanxiety things like worrying about what others think about me worrying what i will do in future situations ruminating on negative parts of my life despairing alternately demanding attention from people close to me or isolating myself and failing to resist various sinful temptations all of those could be solidly classified as self centered and i want to be rid of all of them at the end of each day as part of the prayer challenge we are supposed to write one selfless and one self centered thought or action i did that day on bad days ive found myself at a loss to think of anything selfless which can be discouraging however i know not all of this is my fault and sometimes i just cant function normally because i feel nasty and dont know how to snap out of it the strongest motivator for me to seek professionalmedicalother help and get to the bottom of the mental issues is that i want to stop feeling so selfcentered so frequently im trying to fight those issues and fight the tendency to guilt myself when i have bad days but also to be wise and discern when i am truly being self centered and ruthlessly excise those patterns which are truly sinful i am not so depressed or scrupulous that i think everything is my fault etc i am not so accepting that i think its okay to stay in this state where i allow my mental issues to perpetuate sinful patterns these things are not completely out of my control even i think but am not sure in the midst of an anxiety attack where i feel i cannot do much i think ill stop my ramble there for now but any thoughts or advice would be very welcome thanks,1,kqhft8

im looking for answers to some less obvious questions any help appreciated so my entire life i am searching for the right spiritual path for me brief look at my post history can explain that a bit more and thats just a tip of an ice cube on top of the iceberg i try to be honest in my search process i dont try to just confirm my opinions and im ok with changing my mind if someone smarter than me proves me wrong im mostly drawn the most to the mystical traditions like buddhism and for some time to the christianjewishbased occult stuff boy that was a wild ride that said i have those safe havens i always come back to cheesy will smiths rap when im sad catholicism when im spiritually lost that said i never stay for long because sooner or later i find that itch that i cant scratch and the more i try to help it the more itches i get i love this sub because you guys and gals seem like a really knowledgeable and mostly experienced bunch so i hope youll bear with me and help me scratch at least some of those itches ill cut to the chase but please forgive me some shortcuts and generalizations ill do my best to not create too many strawmen but im aware that such complex belief system makes it somewhat impossible to not create at least some i mostly wont pose a specific questions i think those will be clear from the following paragraphs ill appreciate any tips sources explanations and whatnot throw what you have at me metaphorically so my itches christianjewish as a pure mythology so this is probably the biggest of the bunch as it basically affects the entire belief system in short the more i read about the history of judaism and later christianity the more i see that most of it is not much different from the other mythologies present in that time and region things like gods name el elohim yahweh the most basic name changes across the old testament its ok if we look at it from the perspective god presents himself from different angles and the names are just the particular characteristics like when four blind people described an elephant you get it however the regions from the time when the biblical stories were developing were full of similar deities with similar to say the least names and functions sumerian mythology being my biggest elephant in the room here gilgamesh creation story tower of babel and multiple other similarities and the fact that especially in the first books of the old testament the god talks about himself in plural the royal we explanation is even more farfetched than the alien theory at least for me not to mention multiple other cultures with similar stories somewhat similar practices etc im rather far from the god was an alien theory and to be honest its just hard for me to reconcile the old testament sounds a lot like another mythology from that period with its a unique story never told before and not based on anything except truth the selective interpretations bear with me im not jumping on the hurr no shrimp bandwagon there are multiple sentences and situations in the bible that get selectively included in rituals mass everyday worship and whatnot however many of those are in my brain super overinterpreted throughout the bible god father tells multiple people many things about what they should do but some of those became high profile practices like half of the mass basically and others are basically if you happen to stumble upon this sentence its cool if you follow it but its ok if you dont so we have marian devotions because jesus said behold your mother and it became basically an industry im ok with the overall sentiment but im super skeptical about the huge forprofit market but we have problems to say the least with keeping other commandments suggestions and recommendations from jesus not to mention tons of stuff that god the father himself told us to do and were arguably far from following i dont get how we get from a somewhat symbolical last supper in the bible to sunday mass neither the last supper happened on sunday nor its presented as this ritualistic although here i admit i havent yet gone deep in my study of history of the mass nor the historical significance of this way of worship apart from the obvious keeping christians together the things is i see a difference between he told us how to live and he told someone what to do at some point the fact that its often challenging to find a correct interpretation is a miracle in and of itself makes it hard to follow the churchs teachings with no question lets face it neither bible nor tradition are clear about plethora of issues church doctors said things now considered plain wrong church as an institution used her position for political downright evil reasons and im not even picking on the usual stuff the official history of the church is controversial in many points at best and the multiple schisms dont help my issue here is that adam and eve sinned ok the bible is a story of how god kindof helps us regain our position and return to the right path ok god gave us the bible as a tool to know him but lets face it just look outside the window and youll see that even the best catholics dont necessarily agree on many points its the strawman i tried to avoid but just scroll through this subreddit and youll get what i mean i get that the message is as good as the person receiving it but uh why not simply make it all as clear as possible this will be downright blasphemous i apologize but many other religions eastern ones mostly like buddhism are crystal clear about multiple social moral and everyday issues and its not like theyre new buddhism was revolutionary too and its technically even older than catholicism so not your typical new age crystal healing inventions i was deep in buddhism and deep in catholicism dogmas aside the overall how to live message is almost identical and the more mystical we get the more similar everything becomes but for some reason only one of those explains things arguably clearer than the other why i know that some of those are nitpicky at best unfair at worst the thing is i would really like to be able to just not think about this i dont have problem with moral issues ie i agree with of christianity the being the warrelated stuff and even with those issues im usually the biggest defender of church teachings among my friends i do believe in something or someone bigger than us and unexplainable for a regular human but i simply have a problem with accepting the catholic explanation as the best and i would really like to because it has tons of other things that i find amazing and missing from other faiths im more than happy to get those issues ripped apart preferably with some nice sources and i apologize if i was too controversial in some points im genuinely looking to find my way so it obviously creates some spiritual tension,1,kqaedx

trying to reconnect with the church this has probably been posted before but i come from a very faithful and faith filled family i was an alter boy and all my interactions with the church growing up were positive when i was a teenager my family was ticked by revelations that eventually led to a family member who was in the clergy having to spend time in jail for abusing young children including family members while being a servant of the church this combined with the loss of my grandfather led to major fractures in our families connections to each other and the church this led me on a journey find god in an institution that did not protect abusers and cover up their sins i explored other christian churches and while the journey was interesting i ultimately came back to the church i recognized that as a human institution relying on flawed humans that god was challenging me to live my life with love and integrity while acknowledging that others were on that journey as well and all of us fail sometimes it has been around years since i have rejoined but i still find it hard to stay connected to the community of believers i live in a neighbour that doesnt have a church so i needed to find one to join as a child i was fortunate in that the neighbourhood church was closer i want to recommit to my faith and i also want to refresh myself since the mass has changed since i was a child is there a course like rcia or alpha that can be taken by lapsed catholics any resources i should access tia,1,kqfeoa

why is the church declining in numbers in the west honest question here i grew up catholic and attended catholic schooling even then i could see that the churchs average age was getting older and older barely anyone from my class attended mass and vocations were similarly almost non existent when i went to mass later on in life i found that i was constantly the youngest one there at least voluntarily there were young children but im not counting them because im sure their parents dragged them there even though im not actively practicing its kind of sad to see such a drastic decline everybody knows by now that church attendance is going down a few years ago the parish priest near my house was lamenting that less and less people were getting baptized non catholic enrollment in catholic schooling was increasing due to the fact that catholics werent having kids at a sustainable rate which brings me to my question is this a demographic thing has the church failed to reach out to people in the west is there something more sinister or nefarious im curious to see why people are falling from the church for me the church that i went to started to become very cliquey and full of drama i remember the choir having this massive fight right before mass one time and half of them were crying it was uncomfortable to say the least it just stopped being a welcoming environment plus the priest appeared to stop giving any effort masses were done in about minutes because his homilies literally consisted of yeah yeah just be nice to each other plus my catholic schooling did nothing to instill any catholic values in us students sorry if this post has already been asked,1,kr9f21

catholicism and virtual reality so ive been back in the faith over a year ago and truly believe that catholicism is the fullness of the truth however i have a dilemma i feel like we live in a virtual reality i dont know why people tell me that christianity and simulation theory are incompatible if god is outside of his creation and is omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient why would him creating a virtual reality take away from his greatness i just feel like we are in a virtual world because it seems like what i see and interact with is based off and does believing we live in a virtual reality make me a heretic is it a sin what if we live in a virtual reality would that affect our christian beliefs,1,kp6ka4

how do i defend my faith against new age beliefs happy new years eve i will be moving into an apartment with my sister my sister is engrossed in new age beliefs horoscopes divination reincarnation crystal powers religious indifferentism and the like and has a lot to disagree on with me i am currently in rcia and was raised in a protestant household i am eager to live with my sister because i truly love her and the apartment will be a step forward for both of us as she returns to college but i expect to be vexed by her new age practices a lot my sister and i are currently living with our parents and even now she is almost constantly telling me my horoscope and putting me into a piscesshaped box i am a timid person and i have no idea how to politely ask her to stop would someone mind giving me advice regarding this it really pains me that my sister no longer believes in god but in metaphysical energies that operate the world or something like that i pray for her every chance that i can and i hope she can come back to jesus however whenever i enter a discourse with her regarding religion i am accused of being judgmental and told that christians cannot judge but i thought that our lord jesus taught in the gospels that hypocritical and rash judgement are wrong unwise and unfair but that reasonable and just judgement are actually crucial acts of love has my judgement been reasonable and just how am i supposed to preach the gospel if i cannot kindly explain to people that they are doing sinful acts which are contrary to gods desires i mean my sister has told me blatantly that she supports witchcraft and practises divination rituals i would truly appreciate any advice for this situation how can i converse with my sister in a way that will hopefully by the grace of god lead her to christ i have done a lot of research on catholicism a years worth before entering rcia in fact but i am certain that i do not know nearly everything that there is to catholicism so if there are any doctrinal or moral errors in this post please edify me thank you for reading my post and giving me your time ,1,ko1bj3
looking for catholic friends so i have been doing some reflecting with the new year and everything and it occurred to me that i have no one to have a secure conversation about my faith to i am a sixteen year old female looking for a catholic who i can be friends with i never really had any friends growing up and though i am close to my sister i cannot talk about a lot of things that truly make me happy because she has different religious beliefs than me a lot of my family has radically different beliefs than me and it makes me feel very lonely very isolated i know i have jesus but i think it is important for me to have at least some people going through the same difficult pilgrimage to talk to i think having some catholic friends will help me with my own spirituality some things about me i am in rcia with my father i like reading the bible and would like someone near my age to gush over it with no youth groups in my area afaik because of the pandemic plus i feel usually more comfortable in teteatete conversations anyways i also really like church history and reading about the early days of the church i have a rabbit named speckles she is fluff she is the cutest animal in existence fight me and has helped me to develop a relationship with st francis of assisi i like to read my favorite fiction book is pride and prejudice by jane austen because it is a cute romance that makes me feel shamelessly feminine as for nonfiction i would have to say story of a soul by st therese of lisieux i listen to pints with aquinas drink tea and listen to pints with aquinas while drinking tea i get extremely nervous online but i think this is just a barrier i need to break to get at least some social interaction i had a bad experience with online friends in the past but i am eager to try again this time in a christian setting thank you for your time and god bless ,1,kor555

primacy of conscience and objective morality so from what i understand the primacy of conscience means that if you believe something is immoral with reasons youre bound to not do it even if the church doesnt say anything about it but for maters the church is silent about does this merely apply to ones personal actions or should people apply it to others for example if someone believes eating meat is immoral and becomes a vegan and they see other people eating meat would they be morally obligated to try and stop other people from eating meat when convenient or do things like ban their children from eating meat etc or should primacy of conscience for matters the church is silent about like the ethics of the consumption of meat only apply to the individual given that the church doesnt prohibit eating meat,1,ko3lfq

the churchs teaching on marijuana tldr the church condemned marijuana usage in church drugs and drug addiction between the weekly posts on marijuana and a couple posts a few months ago concerning trent horns treatment of marijuana i was inspired to write up a thing on the topic ie pages and youtube videos both broken up into five parts with slightly different content the church condemns marijuana usage argument ccc condemns nontherapeutic usage of dangerous drugs marijuana is a dangerous drug like cocaine and heroin see church drugs and drug addiction therefore marijuana falls under the condemnation of ccc the reasoning for is that drug abuse is a mortal sin because it is an abdication of ones vocation to be a person it is ultimately an act of despair to cancel out ones existence for further information you can check out part i of my article series or video series in defense of cannabis has been linked to schizophrenia psychosis suicide suicide ideation suicide completion anxiety depression bipolar in addition to other pharmacological effects the magisterium lists several of these effects in church drugs and drug addiction which i summarized in part i this is further developed in part ii of my article series and video series some object that marijuana should be treated like alcohol in the mind of the church this is not defensible citing the catechism charter for health care workers and church drugs and drug addiction i then develop a theological understanding of drugs and alcohol i argue that drug abuse is the same type of sin as alcohol abuse given what the church teaches concerning alcoholism therefore since drunkenness is a mortal sin according to scripture cf gal that can lead one to hell so can drug abuse in opposition scripture calls for a virtue of sobriety i next develop the typology of alcohol based on the old and new testaments and the notion that wine is the blood of the grape this corresponds to part iii of my article series and video series in part iv of my video series i present a catholic approach to when one can use medical marijuana according to the principle of double effect next i examine joseph ratzingers theology of drugs and the origin of modernitys drug crisis in his book a turning point for europe he argues that the cause is due to the acceptance of the distinction between the world of facts and the world of feelings the first is objective and the second subjective the world of feelings pertains to aesthetics morality and religion the first refers to science nature and quantification from this follows the ideological separation of morality from being and the essence of things identifying morality with the process of becoming and the future this ideological schema validates abortion euthanasia drugs and terrorism this corresponds to part iv of my article series and part v of my video series i last consider the question whether one can use drugs to induce religious experience to which i answer no incorporating the philosophies of martin buber and rudolph otto and integrating some catholic demonology this corresponds to part v of my article series thank you for your time for those unfamiliar ive spent most of this year working on various topics concerning vatican ii since the marijuana project is complete i am now returning to my project on hermeneutics on vatican ii previous vatican ii posts my dignitatis humanae reddit post my vatican ii is a gift of the holy spirit post my post on vatican iis continuity,1,kp7j19

a story of my encounter with christ hello everyone im glad i have found this subreddit for christian testimonies ive been looking for one in a long while because it is relatable and fun its fun to know stories of christian conversions as i enjoy the memories that brought myself to christ and be amazed of gods transforming power i am an ordinary guy raised by christian parents attending church service every sunday and went home like nothing happened its been that way for so many years until i decided to cut the process and do my way atheism i stopped believing on anything supernatural in my not only that it disappointed my christian parents i was also subconsciously destroying family relationship i was living idly jumping from one job to another i was this purposeless joe who blame others for my failures since i got no stable job and could barely support myself i stayed with my parents my mom particularly has never given up on my spiritual life as she was so persistent like annoyingly persistent on having me prayed over with her church friends i get particularly annoyed whenever she insists a verse from the bible and some christian stories and how i fell into a sorry state due to me not having christ in my heart one time she had these visitors from church and were like bible sharing and prayer meeting i wanted them stopped and turned on rock music like in a deafening decibels which made them stop i see them as bunch of hypocrites who cant practice what they preach and beg money through charities then i had an exgirlfriend who was a christian and we had this on and off relationship the last time we were together she told me to attend a service and i was like okay just to make her feel fine it was my first service in a decade and i was just chilling out just feeling the place nothing supernatural happened i was in this nostalgia while listening to the sermon and the hymns and handshakes greetings and all that as i was churchgoer myself as a kid then on my way home something weird happened i was consumed with such tranquility so so deep like i wasnt a sentimental guy in my life but i was in tears it felt like i can solve all the problems in the world felt like i can forgive everyone who did me wrong in a snap no ego no hatred just pure love happiness very very very peaceful i cant perfectly describe the sensation i was trying to calm myself down think rationally then i have decided to give myself time to reconsider everything that happened i experimented with reading a bible i took my moms bible and for the first time in a decade i read a bible i told myself that if this reading stops in a week then this thing isnt real but the following sunday not only that ive kept the bible i was also attending a church service church time in years ive tried a discreet approach i dont want attention and get embarrassed in the process in my mind i was just experimenting but the more i try to hide my blossoming love for christ the more i get noticed my bible has been discovered my hushed voice whenever i sing christian songs is heard my shares and posts in social media are liked and shared and i was growing in faith i was also losing ego i actively search for christian family and get connected the changes within me was getting louder and i was reconnecting to my family i am getting rid of old habits and everything just happened so natural not forced definitely not forced years have passed and this thing never waned but getting stronger more mature ive never done anything worthy to deserve gods salvation he just love me i am saved by the grace of god commentsshareedit post,1,kodqgq

praying the rosary with perspective okay so ive said recently that ive started praying rosaries decades a day and you can imagine that it does get tiring because i pray them all back to back rather than breaking them up throughout the day well i was praying my rosaries last night and suddenly got the idea that i should pray each decades focusing on a different persons perspective i prayed from marys perspective imagining i was her in so many situations of her life the sorrowful mysteries gave me genuine anxiety and pain when i imagined everything from her limited perspective and the glorious mysteries filled me with so much joy and humility just imagine if you were being crowned queen of heaven and earth by the holy trinity and everyone in the whole world is saying hail your name full of grace it was a surreal experience to meditate on then i placed myself in the shoes of people who were apart of the mysteries and i was filled with so much joy and awebut also confusion and fear at times it made a lot of peoples reactions in scripture make sense to me like when i was meditating on the agony in the garden i imagined being the apostles and seeing jesus worried and anxious while not understanding he was about to be killed i imagined falling asleep in anxiety and waking up to see him covered in bloody sweat i thought how i might be disturbed and start to doubt in him and how i might be afraid for my own safety if i saw that the lord was so distressed near me and i had always relied on him for help and consolation lastly i imagined everything from jesuss perspective the joyful mysteries were my favorite i thought how excited i jesus must have been that he was about to get a mom and that his mom agreed to have him i thought about him being carried around in her womb to elizabeths house and him speaking to john the baptist from wombtowomb then at the nativity i thought of how jesus finally met his mom and saw her face to face for the first time and was held in her arms and how he basically had the best first birthday ever because his friends from heaven got to be there the angels and the shepherds and magi who he invited by the angels and he was also chilling with his earthly father the righteous st joseph i could go on about the mysteries but ill end with saying the institution of the eucharist was kind of trippy to think about i realized that jesus was breaking the bread and pouring the wine and he was the bread and wine i felt like i was imagining myself in multiple places at once like i was cloned and then inside of the disciples and united with them after they ate the bread and wine it felt so real and is kind of difficult to process and explain today i might do decades from the perspective of god the father but i dont know if you have other suggestions let me know its interesting how when we read the bible we get an omniscient birdseye view theres nothing we dont know we know mary is pregnant by the holy spirit when joseph doesnt we know jesus will die and rise from the dead when the disciples dont we know the end of everyones lives and how everything will unfold so theres not much anxiety and awe like there is for the people who had to live through those things they were taking things daybyday not knowing what the future would hold and had very limited information also lastly this post is getting kind of long i always tear up at the last glorious mystery before going back to the annunciation its just like wow mary did you know that you would be our mother did you know that you would be so highly honored and your name would be most holy did you know you would merit to become the most important woman in the history of humanity above all gods creation just because you said yes as a teenage girl you are so worthy mama and still doing great things on the earth even now blessed are you hail mary full of grace okay im done here this was too long tldr if you pray multiple full rosaries a day consider meditating on the mysteries from a different persons perspective each time ex marys jesuss the other people in the mystery good the father etc,1,kobjjm
jesus on purity at the wedding at cana at the close of the banquet the bridegroom went to jesus and spoke to him very humbly in private he told him that he now felt himself dead to all carnal desires and that if his bride would consent he would embrace a life of continence the bride also having sought jesus alone and expressed her wish to the same effect jesus called them both before him he spoke to them of marriage of chastity so pleasing in the sight of god and of the hundredfold fruit of the spirit he referred to many of the prophets and other holy persons who had lived in chastity offering their bodies as a holocaust to the heavenly father they had thus reclaimed many wandering souls had won them to themselves as so many spiritual children and had acquired a numerous and holy posterity jesus spoke all this in parables of sowing and reaping the young couple took a vow of continence by which they bound themselves to live as brother and sister for the space of three years then they knelt before jesus and he blessed them this except is from the life of jesus according to the visions of blessed anne catherine emmerich i thought this was a beautiful passage and wanted to share it i was pretty sure i read somewhere else based on the visions of the mystics that jesus spoke of purity at the wedding and said that the more chaste a couple is the more holy their child is and he also said that even after conception and birth the couple should still guard their chastity because it will effect the child and they will increase in holiness even after they are already born remember that sexual temptation is a form of suffering offer it up for the conversion of poor sinners or as jesus says offer your body as a holocaust to your heavenly father as seen from the couple in this story you can do this even if youre married god bless you all i hope everyone has a great year ,1,kogghu
today i learned the truth about spiritual communions i saw this quote by st leonard of port maurice on pinterest that said if you practice the holy exercise of spiritual communion several times each day within a month you will see yourself completely changed i decided to look up the quote because i still dont really understand spiritual communion or howwhy i would do them multiple times i day i got the impression from some comments here that spiritual communions arent a very real or valid practice and dont have any power the way that real communions do i got the same impression from some peoples comments about online mass and adoration livestreams my current situation in life is complicated so i cant go to mass rcia or visit a church i watch the mass online every morning and facetime jesus by viewing to adoration livestreams i do spiritual communions but i felt like none of these practices really counted for much i was crying almost all last night while talking to jesus on the adoration livestream i was telling him that i wanted to take communion and be united to him not feel the distance like i was then where i had to worship far off and behind a screen and i also read the vision that blessed anne catherine emmerich had about wedding at cana yesterday she saw that after the people drank the wine that jesus transformed from water they were all spiritually strengthened and became holy because of it and they all had absolute faith in jesus because of the spiritual power infused into it then jesus hinted that he would do a greater miracle in the future by turning bread into flesh and wine into blood i felt it was such a perfect place to introduce the mystery because the wedding and marriage is all about two people becoming one flesh and the mystery of the eucharist is that we become one body with christ when partake of it i felt such a deep longing for that and kept crying while praying spiritual communions i felt like it was all in vain though because its not a real sacramental communion it was only today while talking to jesus on the adoration livestream again that i looked up that quote about spiritual communions to see what would come up i found an article on different saints talking about making acts of spiritual communions this quote changed everything for me spiritual communion as st thomas aquinas and st alphonsus liguori teach produces effects similar to sacramental communion according to the dispositions with which it is made the greater or less earnestness with which jesus is desired and the greater or less love with which jesus is welcomed and given due attention father stefano manelli and then i read this st catherine of sienna once saw jesus holding two chalices he told her in this golden chalice i put your sacramental communions in this silver chalice i put your spiritual communions both chalices are quite pleasing to me so now i am so happy knowing that my spiritual communions are valid and i can get similar effects of communion even though i cant take it sacramentally right now today feels like one of the happiest days of my life i just wanted to share this for others who cant take communion right now but want to god bless you all tldr i thought spiritual communions werent valid like real communions but today i found out they have similar effects to the real thing and jesus is pleased with them,1,kp9z4g
does anyone want to join me on habitica gamifying the catholic life in case you dont know what habitica is its a rpg game that gamifies your life see how i have mine set up here for habits i have a few simple ones i want to make the sign of the cross say a hail mary and jesuss or yeshuas before i do anything i read that one saint suggested saying a hail mary before each task another recommended making the sign of the cross before each task and jesus told st faustina to say jesuss before each mundane thing we do in honor of his humanity so i say jesuss before i use the bathroom and i remember that jesus also used the bathroom because he was human and i marvel at that and feel like my pees are more special and elevated for dailies i have my daily tasks listed mostly prayers i pray each day you can also set recurring tasks that dont repeat everyday so if you pray the litany of st joseph every wednesday you can set things up so it only shows on that day if you only go to communion once a week or month you can also set a daily for that to dos are mostly for one time tasks im obtaining graces for my sisters salvation and later the rest of my family so im setting those as tasks in my to do list lastly there are rewards when you complete your dailies and todos and increase your habits you get coins and sometimes rewards like pet eggs potions and food you can buy gear and stuff with the coins theres nothing left to by on my rewards page because i bought everything i can still open the armoire for coins and get mystery prizes though by completing your daily tasks and doing good habits you level up your character if you have friends on the app you can join a party and do quests together fighting monsters you win rewards in the end if your partners dont check off their dailies everyone loses health and takes damage from the boss youre fighting there are also badges and achievements you can unlock in the game i know this all probably sounds really nerdy but its fun for me and i have no friends please join me guys i just want to fight monsters together and win cool prizes heres my userid message me if you want to join and be apart of my party i can also give you advice about setting things up if you want god bless you all also you dont have to make all your goals and tasks spiritual you can add mundane things like eat vegetables or brush teeth before bed i made all my habitsdailies spiritual because seek first the kingdom is my bible verse for this year i decided to make eventual sainthood my main focus for ,1,kpur9f
someone yelled at me to take my toddler out of mass today hes months old and doesnt make it through mass sitting quietly its not really a strength among the toddler set he wasnt screaming but wanted to move around and babble so i let him walk the back of the church a bit and then decided it was time to get him out and followed him towards an exit door as i was leaving an older man who had been glaring at us all mass said maam please take him out loudly enough for everyone in the immediate area to hear unfortunately this is a very small parish and you can hear everything even in the narthex the cry room has been closed for covid reasons ive asked the priest twice to consider reopening it so there is literally nowhere to go but outside we do our best to keep the kids quiet but the toddler is making it difficulti told the priest as much when i asked about the cry room it doesnt help that most families arent attending right now due to covid there are very few people at mass and we are often the only ones with young children however ive seen how unengaged my older kids are with the livestream and feel they absolutely need to be there and my recent first communicant needs to have the opportunity to receive the eucharist so we go its seems like such a little thing but it was so humiliating i started tearing up and took him outside and another older man came out and said dont worry he wasnt bothering anyone i took him back in to get communion and ended up right behind the offended party in line and then went outside again while waiting for my husband and older children the offended party came up to me again and asked why i just couldnt go to the cry room at that point i was visibly upset and it just all came out i explained exactly why we couldnt go to the cry room and that i would love to be there and to please have some grace for a family trying to make sure their kids get to mass in the difficult circumstances of a pandemic i also said that it was very hurtful for him to do that he doubled down and said it was so bad he couldnt hear the homily it was not i may have then said something about the church dying if kids arent allowed so he might need to get used to it he then yelled something back about being a parishioner there for years and left honestly this makes me not want to go back a little bit ive been worried about this situation since we moved here as our previous parish in another state was much more welcoming to children and this one has families but is just so small and quiet weve felt welcome in every other way and i love it for its smallness too but man today hurt ive never felt so unwelcome in my life obviously we are going to go back next week but i dont know what to do except stand outside the building the whole mass or go to mass in shifts not usually possible with my husbands work schedule the man was aggressive enough that i could see him doing it all over again and i really dont want to do that,1,kpey7s

the catholic church as a force for evil in the world the catholic church is the largest christian denomination boasting over billion adherents making it the largest denomination of any religion in the world by way of having this many followers coupled with a tax free status and the expectation of it followers to offer up of their income to the church the catholic church is also the richest religious organization in the world with an unknown amount of wealth estimated in the high billions like all other revealed religions it claims to be the one true church of the one true god with the one true claim to moral and spiritual authority how if any of those claims are true the catholic church can claim to represent an omniscient omnipotent and omnibenevolent god while at the same time presiding over and covering up the systematic rape of children in their care is beyond my capability to understand this fact alone should be enough for those billion believers to abandon the church to the ruin it deserves it may not be enough for most people to completely abandon their faith but it should be enough for them to stop supporting this evil organization to quote from your own holy book matthew says of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravenous wolves will know them by their fruits do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles so every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire by their fruits you will know them you can clearly see the absolutely rotten fruits of the catholic church in the face of a young boy who has been repeatedly raped by a man whom he has been conditioned to see as the representative of an all good and all powerful god therefore by the logic of the gospel of matthew the catholic church should be destroyed and cast into the fire of progress a common defense against this is one rotten apple doesnt spoil the bunch one rotten priest doesnt outweigh all the good the the church does in the world the fact is that the entire tree is rotten to its core producing only the occasional good fruit the entire organization on every level from the the average believer in the pew all the way up to the vicar of christ on earth the pope was either directly involved in sexually assaulting children covering it up or ignoring it there was very clearly a systematic and institution wide complicity in this horrendous crime and it was too well organized and hidden from public knowledge for this to be a new phenomenon its probably been happening for centuries this corruption has reached the very heart of the catholic church and makes its good deeds nothing but atonement for its heinous crimes this problem however isnt exclusive to catholicism more and more reports of rape and other kinds of sexual assault of both children and adults have been coming from religious denominations around the world for a very long time it is clear that when these clergymen who are obsessed with the sexual restrictions of archaic holy books and believe that they are commandments from god are given total control over people who see these men as their only link to the divine they will be driven by their position of power and their primal sexual instincts to abuse that position for sexual pleasure it is not just a catholic problem its a religion problem get rid of the ancient misogynistic sexually repressive myths and you no longer give these men a position of absolute moral and spiritual authority from which to lord themselves over helpless and in some cases literally voiceless victims for decades and decades at a time without these religious organizations there will still be people who use their positions of power to sexually abuse people the only difference is those people wont be claiming to be acting on behalf of a morally infallible god whose plan must have included a priest raping deaf kids at school they would have no organization to fall back on for protection they would face the secular justice that they deserve instead of being protected by religious law at this point anyone who still supports the catholic church is at the very least silently complicit in the systematic rape of hundreds of thousands of children i believe that the root cause is religion itself and that the horrendous acts of the catholic church are only a symptom of a larger cause religion has done far more harm than good in the world and should be replaced but that replacement has to be done one brick at a time until we have taken every brick from religion and repurposed it towards building a better future follow me on instagram atheistquotes christopher hitchens intelligence squared debate the catholic church is a force for good in the world these are very serious matters theyre not be laughed off by references to the occasional work of catholic charities but i draw your attention not just to the apologies ladies and gentlemen but to the evasive and euphemistic form that they take joseph ratzinger the current pope considered by some by catholics to be the vicar of christ on earth in his comment one of the few hes made on the institutionalization of rape and torture and maltreatment of children in catholic institutions he has said its a very severe crisis which involves us he said in the following in the need for applying to these victims the most loving pastoral care well im sorry theyve already had that and to say that this is the responsibility laid upon you by the horrific admission that you already had to make is not accepting responsibility in any adult sense when i say child abuse was institutional how dare i say so how can i prove such a thing well ill ask his grace and ill ask ann widdecombe where is cardinal bernard law now where is he where is the cardinal archbishop of boston whose resignation was indignantly demanded finally by members of the church and by the whole laity of massachusetts who also demanded his prosecution for the promotion and protection and covering up and apology for and defense of people whose crimes against children are too revolting to specify and hes not in the jurisdiction of massachusetts now as perhaps you know hes the supreme vicar of the church of santa maria maggiore in rome personally appointed by the pope to that as well as to many other important sinecures and in this man a fugitive from justice and from complicity in the filthiest crime that is possible for human beings to imagine was one of those voting in conclave to decide who the next vicar of christ on earth will be i dont know i think id like to hear a bit more shame about this i think id like to see a bit more confrontation with the reality of the business now this is a serious question as ive said ann widdecombe very often rightly in my opinion attacks the climate of moral relativism and if anything goes that can very well be the handmaiden of postmodernist hellenistic culture i very often am glad that she points these things out but the rape and torture of children is not something to be relativized its not something to be excused as a few bad priests its certainly not to be excused by the hideously false claim made by some catholic conservatives that this wouldnt have happened if queers hadnt been allowed into the church sorry to say that queerdom in the church is an old story too at its worst its much worse than pornography and is much worse than bad language on tv and its the crime that cries out for punishment its the thing that if we were accused of on this side of the house we would die rather than admit and if we were guilty of it would kill ourselves and its the one thing the churches decided to excuse itself for under this papacy how can this church say it has any moral superiority it has difficulty catching up to what ordinary people regard as common moral and ethical sense and it still cant make itself apologize properly and ill tell you why because and i quote again from the encyclicals it is said of the crusades of the complicity with the holocaust of the political and diplomatic alliance with fascism of all of these things it is said well violence was committed but ill stress this ill underline it ill quote directly in the service of the truth so how is an apology possible how is any understanding or undertaking or firm purpose of amendment to be allowed when the original sin so to say the radix malorum the fonz at origo the problem in the place is the belief on the part of this church that it does possess a truth that we dont have and it does have a god given right a warrant a mandate of heaven to tell other people what to do not just in their public but in their private lives and until that is changed until that fantastic and sinister and nonfounded claim is changed these crimes will go on repeating themselves being partially denied partially admitted when its too late to do anything else and covered up behind these crimes and miseries is the denial of what we on this side of the house affirm which is that the only little candle of hope that our species does possess is the unfettered intelligence the method of free inquiry in philosophy and in science and the refusal to admit that any one person can tell you not to do that its the one thing i might say i think is if not sacrosanct or sacred is shall we say essential and the church has always stood and still stands against it,1,kopjum

calling to religious life and being an artist dear everyone i just want to have a little conversation about the following topic is it possible to be a working artist and have a calling for the priesthood or religious life i would love to hear some storys examples tips or information on this topic short backstory me discerning if i have a calling to the priesthood but also am a fulltime artist doing multiple creative projects with youth and paintings drawings and digital graphic design work i am fasting a month on meat alcohol smoking and entertainment to discern if i am called already were called in my life it is not like this came up just this month but of course played a role in my life already also in my both failed relationships i know god gave me this talent to be creative and do something with it in the world but i also believe that is should not keep me from being a priest or answering another celibatelife call but of course i have some concerns there although i trust in his leading hand questions like do you even have time as a priest to still work on other creative projects is it possible to do this in a ecumenical way eg oh you are a priest i wont work with you on this or that project i know maybe practical simple or even stupid questions but as an artist they are worth concerning thanks and blessing,1,kqb9rp
an argument for god from inductive skepticism the belief in something does not justify an assertion of knowledge of it atheists often take this to mean that we should only believe those things which can be founded upon empirical evidence this is the spirit of skepticism however i will demonstrate how the logical conclusion of the application of this skepticism to induction itself necessitates the existence of god i will be using some technical language including the uncommon term omnificence in this post for this audience in particular it should be noted that i am not advocating from occasionalism in no way should the use of the term omnificence in the conclusion of this argument imply occasionalism if you have any questions or critique please let me know as i will be posting this to rdebatereligion tomorrow and i want it to be solid the induction fallacy inductive reasoning relies upon noninductive premises for validity this is necessarily true as the use of induction to reach necessary conclusions solely based on induction implies falling into the induction fallacya form of question begging ill demonstrate suppose you live on an island where all the dogs are german shepherds every day you go outside and observe only german shepherds you conclude using the following argument that you will only ever see german shepherds all dogs so far have been german shepherds the future will resemble the past conclusion all dogs will be german shepherds premise has a major problem namely that in order to conclude inductively that the future will resemble the past you must argue something along the lines of the future so far has resembled the past the future will continue to resemble the past conclusion the future will resemble the past this is classic example of begging the question because the conclusion is the same as one of the premises this is of course the fallacy of circular reasoning because induction as shown above is not purely formal in the way deduction is the following statement cannot be necessarily true all es so far observed are fs conclusion therefore all es are fs this is not true of the related deductive argument all es are fs x is an e conclusion therefore x is an f a refutation of relativism in response to the above where induction was shown to not be a independently foundational means of gaining knowledge one might be tempted to throw out all knowledge however skepticism of induction does not mean skepticism of all knowledge is justified in fact the rejection of all knowledge is selfrefuting if one were to say it is absolutely true that there is no absolute truth then they would be selfreverentially incoherent as the statement itself is an admission of absolute truth and is thus a contradiction to avoid this contradiction we must conclude that there there is at least one absolute truth that being the existence of absolute truth qua absolute truth this proposition however trivial is important lets call the proposition that truth exists p omnificence there is a finite or infinite class of actual beings such that for any contingent proposition p if p then some being in this class could have brought about that p therefore there is a finite or infinite class of actual beings such that for any contingent proposition p if p then some being in this class did bring about that p therefore there is an actual g such that for any contingent proposition p if p then g brought about that p from this we can make some surprising observations notably this g has an attribute related to but distinct from omnipotence whereas omnipotence might be defined as the ability to actualize all potentials this g has the added attribute of what we might term omnificence omnificence might be defined as that which for every contingent truth brings it about so that it is so in other words omnipotency is the attribute of having the ability to bring about all potencies omnificency is the attribute of having actually done so omnificence implies omnipotence defense of implying suppose were true for any proposition p but were false then for any proposition p it would be possible that someone knows that p but there would be some proposition q such that q is true but no one knows that q substitute the true proposition q and no one knows that q for p in then you can apply modus ponensand you can infer that it is possible that someone knows that q and no one knows that q yet that is absurd therefore entails defense of implying suppose were true but false then for any proposition p there would be someone who knows that p but for each person x there would be some proposition qx that x does not know form the conjunction x of all the true propositions of the form qx and x does not know that qx this conjunction will be true substitute this true conjunction for p in then you can infer that there is someone y such that y knows that x this means that y knows this conjunction x even though one of its conjuncts asserts that qy and y does not know that qy yet that is absurd therefore entails conclusion skepticism shows us that induction cannot alone be an independently foundational means of obtaining knowledge however this skepticism cannot be applied to all forms of obtaining knowledge without contraction this implies the existence of at least the aforementioned proposition p the existence of this proposition implies an omnificence brought it about this is necessarily true as a fact of logic as the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises and the premises are founded

nonreligious theist went to a church today i spoke with a priest about what im feeling in life my anxieties my sufferings etc i must say even though im not quite convinced in christs historical resurrection yet i found his answer powerful i teared up but part of me realizes that this doesnt necessarily entail the truth of a belief system muslims jews mormons can become emotional while considering their respective religious narratives hell i tear up every time sam carries frodo up mount doom the priest framed christ as the redemptive figure that suffers with me that is always with me i think metaphysically god or a prime mover is necessary i just havent jumped on the whole divine revelation wagon i walked in front of the tabernacle from my studies of early christianity i realized how sacrosanct it is i bowed and knelt though im not fully a believer i could feel the ancient reverence due to the eucharistic the esoteric ambiance of the catholic faith i would love to have a sensus divinitatis having expunged a corrosive scientific materialism from my worldview im much more open to a radical shift in my metaphysical understanding of reality and its interactions with the transcendent part of me wants this because my brother is suicidal work is stressing me out and there are moments of the night where i wake up and my life feels meaningless where i wonder what the entire project of the cosmos is why is there suffering contrary to many a reddit atheists i think religion is the great poetic answer to human suffering not a blissful ignorance of it i mean for gods sake the entire christian project is born out of the redemptive story of christs suffering if any religion is an answer to the woes of mankinds collective suffering its christianity,1,kp6ilu

why would i bother god greetings everyone theres this thing i was thinking about lately which is basically praying in order to ask something i know thats the point of the prayer to express our gratitude and to ask mercy and help on things we cant fully manage in our life but the question is should i really ask god for something of whichever reason i feel a bit of shame doing that knowing that other people pray more than me and often for vital reasons which can be the health of a close person to make an example ive already been blessed countless times he listened to my prayers even when ive felt unworthy of that and when it happened it changed my life to make a concrete example im asking to find a stable job in order to help my parents with their financial issues and to start making a living for myself im one would say just put more effort apparently you havent done enough god has nothing to do with this youre prolly lazy and this is why i have issues with myself and with my relationship with god something that makes me think hes too busy listening to people in real need you can manage to survive on your own am i the only one who have ever felt like this sorry for eventual errors its not my primary language but i hope its understandable,1,ko3tr4

am i being scrupulous hey there ive come back to the catholic faith in recent months and have begun to dig into the word and develop a prayer life but my problem is that i think i may be praying too frequently and picking up on errors to the point where i have trouble ending a prayer because i feel the need to start the prayer over again repeat certain phrases ask for forgiveness numerous times or do the sign of the cross multiple times until i feel confident enough that i prayed it well in addition to this i frequently have intruding thoughts like thinking blasphemous sacrilegious crazy inappropriate thoughts thinking i said part of the prayer wrong or thinking i wasnt paying enough attention because of my problems i tend to take considerably longer to pray than i really mean to which can be quite draining and frustrating at times one other thing i have a problem with is praying in public eg the grocery store or in front of family at home i find myself praying every few minutes sometimes and i feel the need to do the sign of the cross while im in public because i am afraid that if i dont it would count as me chickening out and being ashamed of being seen in prayer and therefore being ashamed of jesus and obviously none of us want to be ashamed of him i dont always look like im praying because in these type of situations im usually praying mentally or silently mouthing words but ever since i began to become concerned about coming off as ashamed of jesus ive begun to just do the sign of the cross after each time i pray like this because i dont want to take the chance but am i just being scrupulous with this and dont really need to do the sign of the cross every single time or should i just continue to do this ive heard that god could use it as an opportunity to witness but i just wonder if i can talk to him without needing to do the sign of the cross each time i do now that i think about it as i write this i think that i probably could talk to him and end my short little conversationrequest without doing the sign of the cross in public but i just want to make sure now im getting over the fear of saying grace before eating in public places or at home before meals as gods opinion should really be the only opinion i value above all others but i just wonder about whether i need to do the sign of the cross if its for small brief requestsprayers for really anything most of the time i find myself wanting to pray about various little things or perhaps big things like just asking for help giving thanks or praying for someone i see who is in need but doing it like how i mentioned earlier mentallysilently and doing the sign of the cross at the end i know that other denominations dont find it necessary to do the sign of the cross but as a catholic i just feel the need to end my prayer with the sign of the cross even for the shortest prayers and because i pray so often i wonder if i even need to do the sign of the cross each time i pray or if im just being scrupulous i also plan on consulting with my confessor on this issue as he tends to have useful advice for me each time i come to him with questions so hopefully ill get some help there as well your input about this would be greatly appreciated happy new year ,1,ko3o7h

help accepting allmale priesthood teaching quite honestly i struggle with this teaching i am trying to reconcile it and be faithful but its an ongoing struggle for me i need to learn more about it so i can accept it faithfully the biggest sticking point for me is that christ became human to save humans so if were saying men are a fundamentally different matter than women and men match christ but women dont doesnt this suggest women arent saved or not saved in the same way men are if anyone has a theological way around this that supports the church teaching id be grateful im familiar with the other reasoning like the apostles being male but i dont find many of them entirely convincing,1,kr328s
advice on moving out after becoming catholic first off a bit of honesty i have not been confirmed yet so i havent officially become catholic however after close to years of anything from passive interest to intense research ive come to conclusion that the catholic church is the church that christ founded and i agree with all the teachings therein not really looking to debate that since what i really need is some advice i still live at home and always have with the exception of a year lease i had in after telling my parents both pentecostal christians dad is ordained mom is licensed what i was doing they absolutely blew up they are reluctant to see logic and they refuse to study church history they refer to the catholic church as a cult they pull out fundamentalist arguments that ive never heard them use before and they are convinced that im throwing my soul away i knew that i needed to move but after this its been made even more clear to me and the sooner the better id like to have this conversation with them within the next weeks ive historically been a screwup and between my brother also converting but lives in a different city most of the time and me ive been in trouble the most by a long shot because of that my parents cant see me as any different than i used to be despite many positive life changes that i have implemented and seem to be unable to view me as anything mkre than a child what advice do yall have for this situation i need to move out period i dont need their money and have a full time job that makes me able to live pretty comfortably and although ive tried to be as charitable as i can theres not really a way that this can go smoothly except to rip the bandaid off now as it were and pick up the pieces later thoughts,1,kptfwm

would jesus consume media should i consume media which ones ok so i know most media has sin in it unless its like a documentary or something and im being more and more cautious about these things especially after digging deeper in the catholic faith but i guess the main concern i have is with video games and i guess tv maybe its just scruples but i dont know how i should feel about cartoon violence and other themes like stomping on a goomba or an episode of mr bean or to use a popular example harry potter as well as pirated videos uploaded to youtube and potentially copyright infringing things such as parodies or skits involving video game characters etc i know were supposed to do things in moderation but how much is too much i know ive been doing too much since media has been the focus of most casual conversations i have as well as being in my thoughts but it hasnt exactly led me to sin save for the times i got frustrated and i think visualised whacking a butterfly in my mind when i saw one because of hammering an origami one from a game aside from the ways i used to obtain games such as dabbling in piracy and listening to ripped music of any kind i guess and lying to get money im considering deleting my previous posts too since they were pretty mean as well as getting rid of pictures which may violate copyright law im not really into mature things but i have considered buying a rated t game which i think it was just because of the gold points about to expire p and i did watch several things on netflix and occasionally when my parents are around which i plan on stopping but i guess the questions i have are would jesus play video games or watch media or at least approve of it if he were to become man again hypothetically would he approve of consuming media and or maybe i shouldnt worry about this too much,1,krsh8w

we should be convinced that what happens happens by the will of god apropos of this it is related that two martyrs epictetus and atho being put to the torture by having their bodies raked with iron hooks and burnt with flaming torches kept repeating work thy will upon us o lord uniformity in all things the essence of perfection is to embrace the will of god in all things prosperous or adverse in prosperity even sinners find it easy to unite themselves to the divine will but it takes saints to unite themselves to gods will when things go wrong and are painful to selflove our conduct in such instances is the measure of our love of god st john of avila used to say one blessed be god in times of adversity is worth more than a thousand acts of gratitude in times of prosperity furthermore we must unite ourselves to gods will not only in things that come to us directly from his hands such as sickness desolation poverty death of relatives but likewise in those we suffer from man for example contempt injustice loss of reputation loss of temporal goods and all kinds of persecution on these occasions we must remember that whilst god does not will the sin he does will our humiliation our poverty or our mortification as the case may be it is certain and of faith that whatever happens happens by the will of god i am the lord forming the light and creating the darkness making peace and creating evil from god come all things good as well as evil we call adversities evil actually they are good and meritorious when we receive them as coming from gods hands shall there be evil in a city which the lord hath not done good things and evil life and death poverty and riches are from god it is true when one offends us unjustly god does not will his sin nor does he concur in the sinners bad will but god does in a general way concur in the material action by which such a one strikes us robs us or does us an injury so that god certainly wills the offense we suffer and it comes to us from his hands thus the lord told david he would be the author of those things he would suffer at the hands of absalom i will raise up evils against thee out of thy own house and i will take thy wives before thy face and give them to thy neighbor hence too god told the jews that in punishment for their sins he would send the assyrians to plunder them and spread destruction among them the assyrian is the rod and staff of my anger i will send him to take away the spoils assyrian wickedness served as gods scourge for the hebrews is st augustines comment on this text and our lord himself told st peter that his sacred passion came not so much from man as from his father the chalice which my father hath given me shall i not drink it when the messenger came to announce to job that the sabeans had plundered his goods and slain his children he said the lord gave and the lord taketh away he did not say the lord hath given me my children and my possessions and the sabeans have taken them away he realized that adversity had come upon him by the will of god therefore he added as it hath pleased the lord so is it done blessed be the name of the lord we must not therefore consider the afflictions that come upon us as happening by chance or solely from the malice of men we should be convinced that what happens happens by the will of god apropos of this it is related that two martyrs epictetus and atho being put to the torture by having their bodies raked with iron hooks and burnt with flaming torches kept repeating work thy will upon us o lord arrived at the place of execution they exclaimed eternal god be thou blessed in that thy will has been entirely accomplished in us cesarius points up what we have been saying by offering this incident in the life of a certain monk externally his religious observance was the same as that of the other monks but he had attained such sanctity that the mere touch of his garments healed the sick marveling at these deeds since his life was no more exemplary than the lives of the other monks the superior asked him one day what was the cause of these miracles he replied that he too was mystified and was at a loss how to account for such happenings what devotions do you practice asked the abbot he answered that there was little or nothing special that he did beyond making a great deal of willing only what god willed and that god had given him the grace of abandoning his will totally to the will of god prosperity does not lift me up nor adversity cast me down added the monk i direct all my prayers to the end that gods will may be done fully in me and by me that raid that our enemies made against the monastery the other day in which our stores were plundered our granaries put to the torch and our cattle driven off did not this misfortune cause you any resentment queried the abbot no father came the reply on the contrary i returned thanks to god as is my custom in such circumstances fully persuaded that god does all things or permits all that happens for his glory and for our greater good thus i am always at peace no matter what happens seeing such uniformity with the will of god the abbot no longer wondered why the monk worked so many miracles uniformity with gods will by alphonsus de liguori doctor of the church,1,kr02tw

opinion on the pope hey yall hope you well im not all that into catholic theology but two things i do understand is that the pope is the head of the catholic chuch and that this particular pope is pretty progressive in comparison to most if not all other popes now i dont know if its considered politics here or if youre even allowed to criticize the head of the religion im sorry if the question offended you if thats the case but id like to hear what actual catholics think about him because most of the comments i hear about him come from the somewhat liberal and not at all christian society i live in thank you all in advance for the answers,1,kqa0xg

in the extraordinary form of the divine office are the votive saturday offices of the blessed virgin mary optional like in the liturgy of the hours divinum officium always seems to use them and has no option to take it off so im a bit confused ,1,kp1ufq
a couple of questions regarding matins for jan did my second attempt at matins from the book today didnt go terrible but there are still some rough spots ironically i found it way easier to put together matins for the sacred name of jesus which is a office of nocturns anyways heres what is perplexing me all went well except when it said collect as in lauds i had no idea where to find it i eventually went to the variable parts of the ordinary and found it is there somewhere more obvious that it was put at divinum officium says it was from the proper of saints which i browsed through but didnt see any saint for christmas the same happened with the invitatory antiphon christus natus est nobis vente adormus instead i used the one from the weekly psalter is there a more obvious place they put this besides the variable parts of the ordinary why was te deum recited today if it was a class holy day i was under the impression its only recited during a class solemnity and a class feast basically the same as in the liturgy of the hours why are propers from christmas still being recited when the octave is over are we not out of it i use the baronius press breviary if anyone else does and could perhaps relay page numbers,1,kq04bv
is there a comprehensive list of the upcoming changes to the liturgy of the hours out there and some more specific questions a few days ago the church released the new translations pdf file for the traditional invitatory of psalm te deum the benedictus the magnificat and the nunc dimittis i was wondering if theres an exhaustive list of all the changes that will be made i was also curious as to if theres a way to view all the new translations for the psalms and nongospel canticles for free online they seem to be selling a book of them but i just want to take a quick peek but more specifically i was wondering if the current translation of the glory be glory to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit as it was in the beginning is now and will be forever amen will be changed to its more popular translation glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end amen thanks,1,kqbq10

forced to mass by grandma im just a teenage boy hey um id like to discuss about a topic regarding about mass so my grandma is a devoted catholic im a catholic myself and ever since i arrived back from abroad i had to go to the us for a year cause of my fathers work and she keeps making me and my family go to mass each day to me i see it as wasting hour of my life since we are devoted to technically go to mass on sundays and if i dont go for a while she tends to get angry at me and even starts a whole discussion on why i need to go so im honestly just annoyed god never forced us to be our followers so i see no point on why she is angry about this but of course i follow the ten amendments and help people while i can since i see no point in causing trouble and going to mass everyday will not guarantee us a passage to heaven since the real judgement is out actions so thanks for listening and please give me your opinions whether im in the right or wrong,1,kq5twl

catholicism of a christmas carol shortly before christmas i watched the classic a christmas carol starring george c scott even though the book was written by charles dickens an english protestant author there seemed so much of it that resonated with the catholic faith apart from the story of scrooges redemption its my belief that jacob marley was a soul in purgatory his ghostly visage wanders around in chains which he says was penance for his sins marley cant have been damned because if he was he wouldnt have desired scrooges repentance or arranged requested god or whomever to send the three spirits i think i remember once a priest said to the extent ghosts exist they are the souls in purgatory he said something oddly beautiful when scrooge tells him he had a good head for business marleys wails in remorse business mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity forebearance mercy this counting house was just a drop in the ocean of what was my business the ghosts spirits strike me as angels sent from god or whomever to work toward scrooges good and repentance all radiated in some form a strong sense of goodness and power frightening as his appearance was i dont think the ghost of christmas yet to come was an evil being more just a manifestation of scrooges dark future if he continued on his path he basically was tough love medicine in the worst way similarly as warm and kind as the ghosts of christmas past and present were they had an edge and power to them they showed both made their scorn and pity for scrooges heart hearted mentality known but also played on the good they found in him such as reminding him that the nephew he hates looks like his deceased sister whom he loved so much im sure there are plenty of others and even more in the book i was just surprised at how spiritual religious this story actually is and how almost unique among christmas specials isnt schlocky or tacky thoughts,1,ko3uyb
harry potter reconsidered hi everyone catholic and big time at one point fan of the harry potter series i well remember at the time they came out late the hysteria from right wing christians about the supposed wickedness and immorality of promoting magic to children at i thought it was absurd particularly since i knew real magic didnt exist and if gandalf merlin and glinda the good witch were kosher than so should harry potter only later in life did i really understand that magic not the storybook kind does exist and is considered immoral whether the moral majority was right or wrong about the books the explosion of interest in wicca and the occult first started right around the time the books were released then there is the books message an unloved and terribly neglected boy finds friendship identity and self worth through his magical powers how many alienated and lonely kids have gotten into wicca tarot cards etc at least in part because of reading the harry potter books and idk i guess im less of a fan of the books then when i was younger jk rowling is a very talented childrens author once the books turn into the young adult genre do they get a little wobbly she doesnt have that great a handle on teen interactions and she seems to validate sort of unhealthy and destructive emotional dynamics professor snape fetishizing harrys dead mother and that alone being the reason he protects yet despises him i find them creative and engaging just growing more deep in my faith and becoming more reflexive do i think they merit at least consideration i know that almost no priests and bishops came out against the books and protesting them wasnt seen as a catholic wedge issue your thoughts,1,kqqjrj

disproving sola scriptura essay i wrote in grade throughout christian history the question has existed over what sources believers can rely on to learn of gods public revelation two prominent theories have developed to answer this question namely sola scriptura held by protestants and the two channels of divine revelation held by catholics sola scriptura teaches that one may only rely on the bible for knowledge of doctrine while the catholic view holds that god makes himself known by both sacred scripture and apostolic tradition the church rejects the concept of sola scriptura due to the two methods of divine revelation how not all doctrine is held in the biblical texts and how scripture cannot stand on its own without magisterial interpretation the church has always held that god revealed himself to mankind through both sacred scripture and apostolic tradition several decades passed between the churchs start at pentecost and when the new testament was written showing how the church relied on oral tradition held and taught by the apostles to affirm its teachings st paul affirms this writing therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which you have learned whether by word or by our epistle thess this gives basis for one to say the faith is upheld like a stool by the legs of tradition scripture and the magisteriums interpretation of both believers are to thus stand firm in both channels of revelation although almost all of christian thought finds its basis in the bible some basic christian doctrines are not explicitly explained in the bible for example the concept of the trinity or the incarnation have no direct reference in the new or old testaments st john the evangelist supports this in writing that there are also many other things which jesus did which if they were written every one the world itself would not be able to contain the books that should be written jn written words in a book may never capture complete understanding of our lords ways and teachings so the church then comes into focus its living magisterial body may fully hold and apply gods ways teachings and will to matters of faith and morals scripture cannot stand alone without magisterial interpretation to explain its meanings sola scriptura entails that no official interpretation of scripture is necessary and that the church cannot validly impose beliefs on the mystical body of christ a biblical account disagrees reading and philip running thither heard him reading the prophet isaias and he said thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest who said and how can i unless some man shew me acts philip then explains the prophets writings to the man and leads him to be baptized representing the church guiding men in understanding the scriptures unto the sacraments the church may indeed comment on scripture this practice composes much of its tradition and other writings all on all sola scriptura is easily debunked by referencing the two channels of divine revelation extrabiblical doctrines and key accounts straight from scripture both scripture and tradition make god known to man and are thus complimentary scripture cannot stand without tradition some simple doctrines such as the trinity are not dogmatically explained in the bible but are still believed by all christians several accounts in the two testaments themselves even teach scripture is not to be solely used in searching the truth the now proven two channels of divine revelation may thus work together in the church to point to their end for all men to come to the fullness of knowledge in christ,1,kodqbm

new music perhaps of interest to catholics ive recorded a number of songs i believe may be of interest to rcatholicism im not motivated to write lyrics about popular topics so i often write about my relationship to god and what appears to be the nature of life on this planet i dont claim any genre but most of it is clearly rock its called all are blue and the entire hour collection can be found on spotify here and utube here i present this to rcatholicism in the hope these may edify help inspire etc i made a deliberate effort to avoid lyrics that are doctrinally incorrect feel free to let me know if you think i got anything wrong catholics may be most interested in these particular songs the ladder spotify link yt link i am singing directly to god he cant simply be heavens realestate agent there has to be more to this life and our relationship to him life would certainly be easier if all we had to do was comply with all the rules and score high enough on the deeds part in the movie dead man walking sister helen prejean told the convict matthew poncelet that he must participate in his own redemption is that what were doing what is the nature of god and why doesnt he appear down here life on earth spotify link yt link why does god allow suffering this song isnt an attempt to explain it rather it is simply an acknowledgement that he does allow it i am familiar with redemptive suffering offering ones pains up for the benefit of the salvation of souls does that explain why the innocent young etc people with no concept of catholicism would have to go through that god is the embodiment of love and fairness so theres got to be a good reason i was particularly moved by this persons disgust in this song i am not complaining to god i am simply describing the situation we all appear to be in this is my attempt to face a hard subject and address it honestly and respectfully feel free to share how you think it could have been improved made more doctrinally sound if you think it isnt etc mother delille spotify link yt link this song is a tribute to the venerable henriette delille she is of particular interest to me because she lived in my part of the world and shares my ethnicity you can see me on my yt channel this is relevant because being a person of color has had a dramatic impact on my life mother delille provides an example of how a person of color can embrace a love of god and self in a world that may appear to do neither note i recorded this song in and did not share it with the world until about a month ago perhaps you can understand that this one is a bit more personal to me than the others so i really wanted the time and circumstances to be right however it started to appear that i may never release this song so this seemed right i really think it deserves a video i dont know when ill get to that heres a news article about mother delille from a new orleans perspective if you are thrown off by the acapella part in the middle i was trying to vocally create the sound of a marching band shadows spotify yt link this song is about platos allegory of the cave i realize this may seem more philosophical than catholic but i believe they are related it seems the point of the allegory is to suggest that every single mysterious odd and hitherto unexplained thing indeed has a very particular cause it also suggests that people on earth are not dealing with a full deck we are experiencing fragments and effects of people or forces that we cannot see it suggests that we may one day understand everything its relevant to catholics due to the fact that atheists often argue the opposite they suggest that whatyouseeiswhatyouget and that there is nothing more to be found they even have the audacity to say that when we die its lightsout and nothingness without having any direct evidence of the matter except for the chatter people generate over the issue of rnde stories with this song i am saying that i disagree with the notion that this is all there is healing spotify yt link its another song about pain in the world in this song i offer no explanation all i offer is to be there to help get through hard times hotel spotify yt link i compare life on earth to a brief stay in a hotel there has to be more to all of this i made a video which took several months i created graphic elements representing god and newly created souls in an effort to perhaps provide clarity about what were all going through not blue anymore spotify yt link the lyrics to this song may seem really odd in the beginning however im just naming mediterranean dishes because im imagining what the banquet in heaven is like st peter tells us in peter that salvation is the goal of our faith im simply expressing in this song the hope that catholics have that whenif they err they have ways to get up and begin again this song suggests that the dark nights we may go through as suggested by the album title eventually end,1,kohkq3

mary and john a role model of growing in prayer ive seen some posts and comments about people asking about the rosary and higher prayer saying to give it up or conversely that we should pray multiple a day heres a proposal for you something that came to me today when i was praying the rosary who among all gods creatures has had the most mystical and sublime prayer life not st teresa of avila not st bruno not st anthony it was our blessed mother who kept and pondered in her immaculate heart the life death and resurrection of her son jesus when mary prayed in the upper room the holy sprit soon descended at pentecost while the apostles were learning vocal prayer mary was the spouse of the holy spirit from the very instant of her conception mary has been in perfect union with god is this not what the goal of prayer is what perfection is union with god for years our lord lived a hidden life with his mother the incarnate word chose to live with her in nazareth imagine the interior life of those years what mary learned in years st john of the crosses and st thomas aquinas couldnt learn if they lived for a thousand years and pooled all their efforts together now after the death of jesus who was so blessed as to receive mary into his home st john look at the difference between john and the other apostles his gospel is chock full of mystical imagery read john and see if the difference isnt clear read his first letter too what made him so different it was surely his time spent living with mary she taught him how to pray and later in life he experienced a vision of the apocalypse how many people have been fed in prayer meditating on what st john wrote the scriptures have given us the easy way of growing to the highest levels of prayer take mary into your house and let her direct your whole life so in conclusion id say that while its possible to grow in virtue and prayer without a huge devotion to mary i think its foolish to go another way st louis de montfort has said its the easy quick and secure way i think thats what he said heres something that i think has been attributed to a few saints so no need to take it as anything beyond pious belief according to the most popular legend st francis de sales had a vision of two ladders to heaven the first one was quite long steep and dangerous and led to heaven through jesus the second ladder was much shorter and easier to climb less steep and led to mary according to this legend jesus told st francis de sales tell your people to come to me by this ladder through my mother,1,kqsm6c
the prophecy of the popes the prophecy of the popes is often incorrectly called the prophecy of st malachy but that saint did not write it the list of predictions was composed by the benedictine monk fr arnold wion sometime around and the first mottoes were made after the fact the roman inquisition formed in and it appears that fr wion used the ruse of attributing his heretical end of the world prophecy to st malachy to avoid being put on trial by this inquisition fr wion published his list of predictions in in the lignum vitae in fr thomas messingham republished fr wions predictions and in so doing made a critical alteration he combined the last two paragraphs into just one thereby shortening the list to every subsequent analyst has repeated messinghams error and that is why the world thinks that the prophecy has failed pope francis is obviously not the petrus romanus of the prediction the motto that actually applies to pope francis is in psecutione extrema sre sedebit he will reign in the final persecution of the holy roman church,1,kp3cps
second interview with fr charles murr on vatican intrigues surrounding cardinals baggio benelli villot and gagnon ,1,krt5w1
is playing god a sin very first sin according to the story was done out of a desire to play god adam and eve wanted to be high and mighty and feel like god and thats why they ate the apple anyway there are many ways of playing god there are ways that are doubtlessly evil like murder there are ways that are quite possibly evil like what dr frankenstein did creating life in a lab there are neutral ways there are ways that are neutral like then there are ways that are seemingly good like helping other people for a sense of power you could give a homeless person food to feel like a bigshot or maybe if youre a doctor you would get that feeling by saving peoples lives so it would certainly seem that playing god is bad until you look closely at the catechism and read where it says adam and eve were destined to be fully divinized so the desire to play god was indeed a good one ironically but they didnt listen to the expert at playing god god himself and tried to do it a different way and it went terribly wrong so this seems to suggest the desire to play god that is feel like a god yourself isnt necessarily bad so my question is could anything good done out of a desire like this be good or would anything done out of this desire somehow pollute it and render it bad,1,kpnisl

question on the authority of the pope few days ago i made a post on the askapriest subreddit but i cant reconcile this matter can someone help the other day i had a hypothetic thought about the next us president and abortion and the pope so my thought was if the president will write abortion right to law should or would the holy father remove him from his position to which the father answered that pope francis wouldnt even consider it i agreed on that but the father also said that he doesnt think that the pope has that kind of power he said that vatican ii makes it clear that the church is not interested in interfering in the functioning of other states i understand that the church doesnt directly involve herself as much as in medieval times in politics but the pope doesnt have power to depose monarchs now on that im completely unsure and im leaning on to disagree and think that the pope has that power st pope gregory vii stated in dictatus papae that it may be permitted to him to depose emperors technically a president is not an emperor of course but an emperor is a higher than a mere president as an emperor is with absolute power in empires st pope gregory vii excommunicated the holy roman emperor henry iv and stripped him off his title also declaring all oaths of allegience to him null and void henry had to walk to canossa and was humilated was kneeling in front of the castle gates for three days and three nights during a raging blizzard before permitted entrance thats where we got the phrase walk to canossa similarly st pope pius v in regnans in excelsis excommunicated elizabeth i of england and stripped her of title and privileges every subject of her was released from all oaths made to her and from obedience to her therefore resting upon the authority of him whose pleasure it was to place us though unequal to such a burden upon this supreme justiceseat we do out of the fullness of our apostolic power declare the foresaid elizabeth to be a heretic and favourer of heretics and her adherents in the matters aforesaid to have incurred the sentence of excommunication and to be cut off from the unity of the body of christ and moreover we declare her to be deprived of her pretended title to the aforesaid crown and of all lordship dignity and privilege whatsoever and also declare the nobles subjects and people of the said realm and all others who have in any way sworn oaths to her to be forever absolved from such an oath and from any duty arising from lordship fealty and obedience and we do by authority of these presents so absolve them and so deprive the same elizabeth of her pretended title to the crown and all other the above said matters people were even forbidden to obey her under pain of excommunication we charge and command all and singular the nobles subjects peoples and others afore said that they do not dare obey her orders mandates and laws those who shall act to the contrary we include in the like sentence of excommunication my line of thinking is if the pope never had that power then it was clearly and obviously wrong for st pope gregory vii st pope pius v pope sixtus v pope martin iv pope innocent iv who used the power twice first against the portugal king sancho ii and against the holy roman emperor fredercik ii at a council at the ecumenical council of lyon in to exercize it but that is impossible right but if the pope had that power back then then he surely has that power now i mean if he doesnt have it now he never had it to begin with and that just sounds completely absurd as history clearly shows that pontiffs exercised said power and deposed emperors and kings alike of course theres the possibility that the pope has no authority for that but to me it seems absurd and unlikely as pope innocent iv did it at an ecumenical council i mean at an ecumenical council had he not the authority bishops would have protested against it yes if we look at the excommunication of frederick ii holy roman emperor we see we therefore after careful discussion with our brother cardinals and the sacred council on his wicked transgressions already mentioned and many more besides since though unworthy we hold on earth the place of jesus christ and to us in the person of the blessed apostle peter has been said whatever you bind on earth etc denounce the said prince who has made himself so unworthy of the empire and kingdoms and every honour and dignity and who also because of his crimes has been cast out by god from kingdom and empire we mark him out as bound by his sins an outcast and deprived by our lord of every honour and dignity and we deprive him of them by our sentence we absolve from their oath for ever all those who are bound to him by an oath of loyalty firmly forbidding by our apostolic authority anyone in the future to obey or heed him as emperor or king and decreeing that anyone who henceforth offers advice help or favour to him as to an emperor or king automatically incurs excommunication let those whose task it is to choose an emperor in the same empire freely choose a successor to him with regard to the aforesaid kingdom of sicily we shall take care to provide with the counsel of our brother cardinals as we see to be expedient to me this just seems so blatanty obvious that the pope has the authority to depose rulers and if the pope had the authority back then he has it now even if not used then theres the condemned false idea of gallicanism that has articles attacking the authority of the church and the pope the first vatican council disproved of tenets of gallicanism and while the first point of gallicanism that says st peter and the popes his successors and the church itself have dominion from god only over things spiritual and not over things temporal and civil therefore kings and sovereigns are not beholden to the church in deciding temporal things they cannot be deposed by the church and their subjects cannot be absolved by the church from their oaths of allegiance was not directly touched by vatican i blessed pope pius ix disproved it as the following errors are condemned in syllabus of errors roman pontiffs and ecumenical councils have wandered outside the limits of their powers have usurped the rights of princes and have even erred in defining matters of faith and morals the church has not the power of using force nor has she any temporal power direct or indirect besides the power inherent in the episcopate other temporal power has been attributed to it by the civil authority granted either explicitly or tacitly which on that account is revocable by the civil authority whenever it thinks fit the sacred ministers of the church and the roman pontiff are to be absolutely excluded from every charge and dominion over temporal affairs that to me seems like pretty solid asserting that the pope has that power to depose monarchs especially in light of the error condemned if saying that the pope wandered outside the limits of their powers and have usurped the rights of princes is an error then it means that the holy father has authority to remove rulers from their position of power to me it solidly looks it is indeed an error as blessed pope pius ix condemned it as such even if we look at the time period the papacy of st pope gregory vii began in the papacy of st pope pius v began in and the papacy of blessed pope pius ix began in is it really possible that blessed pope pius ix was wrong while condemning that as an error and all those holy fathers two of them a saint who deposed both emperors and kings alike were all in error with absolutely no authority to do so uh that just feels like utterly impossible to me and while i realize the possibility of me misinterpreting and misunderstanding all these and the father being right but what if not a priest is obviously more educated and more knowledgable than me so it is entirely possible that my belief in this is false but i also know that no human is perfect and the father could be wrong on this issue however i always had pride problems and this to me that im right and hes wrong in this matter gives me anxiety that this is just my pride on the other hand if i were to accept that im wrong in this i still couldnt reconcile the fact that these things happened and not one not two but pontiffs removed kings and emperors from ther thrones of the pontiffs who are saints and one pontiff who did it at an ecumenical council i simply dont get it i cant understand this but what if me beliving that the pope has authority to do it is contrary to church teaching and thus heretical i couldnt find anything that would disprove that the pope has such authority and that worries me all the more obviously be it far from me to hold on to things and belive things that are against church teaching but i simply cannot understand and cannot see why would it be against it present time i think that the pontiff has the authority if in medieval times they could depose emperors then present time the pope can depose a mere commoner president i think that the pontiff has the authority even if wont possibly excersize it any time soon can someone please help a theological peasant like me understand all this if the pope has the authority for it theres no problem because it is within his rights to not excersize it if however the pope does not have authority for it then how to understand all those popes who excersized it throughout hundreds of years and how to understand how it could have happened especially at an ecumenical council and the errors condemned by blessed pope pius ix in syllabus of errors,1,kq7buc
dignitatis humanae and religious freedom what is the meaning of religious freedom that was professed at the second vatican council to be an inviolable human right two things come to my mind and im leaning towards the latter every men has a right to profess any religion every men has a right to choose the true faith freely without coercion normally when people say religious freedom the one thing coming to my mind always was that everyone can belive in any religion and states have no power to restrict or ban a religion this was when i was atheist obviously this view of mine changed as i adapted a mentality of error has no right after coming to the faith am i wrong though pope gregory xvi writes in mirari vos this shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd and erroneous proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must be maintained for everyone it spreads ruin in sacred and civil affairs though some repeat over and over again with the greatest impudence that some advantage accrues to religion from it but the death of the soul is worse than freedom of error as augustine was wont to say when all restraints are removed by which men are kept on the narrow path of truth their nature which is already inclined to evil propels them to ruin then truly the bottomless pit is open from which john saw smoke ascending which obscured the sun and out of which locusts flew forth to devastate the earth thence comes transformation of minds corruption of youths contempt of sacred things and holy laws in other words a pestilence more deadly to the state than any other experience shows even from earliest times that cities renowned for wealth dominion and glory perished as a result of this single evil namely immoderate freedom of opinion license of free speech and desire for novelty pope leo xiii writes in libertas praestantissimum and in immortale dei from what has been said it follows that it is quite unlawful to demand to defend or to grant unconditional freedom of thought of speech or writing or of worship as if these were so many rights given by nature to man for if nature had really granted them it would be lawful to refuse obedience to god and there would be no restraint on human liberty it likewise follows that freedom in these things may be tolerated wherever there is just cause but only with such moderation as will prevent its degenerating into license and excess and where such liberties are in use men should employ them in doing good and should estimate them as the church does for liberty is to be regarded as legitimate in so far only as it affords greater facility for doing good but no farther doctrines such as these which cannot be approved by human reason and most seriously affect the whole civil order our predecessors the roman pontiffs well aware of what their apostolic office required of them have never allowed to pass uncondemned thus gregory xvi in his encyclical letter mirari vos dated august inveighed with weighty words against the sophisms which even at his time were being publicly inculcatednamely that no preference should be shown for any particular form of worship that it is right for individuals to form their own personal judgments about religion that each mans conscience is his sole and allsufficing guide and that it is lawful for every man to publish his own views whatever they may be and even to conspire against the state on the question of the separation of church and state the same pontiff writes as follows nor can we hope for happier results either for religion or for the civil government from the wishes of those who desire that the church be separated from the state and the concord between the secular and ecclesiastical authority be dissolved it is clear that these men who yearn for a shameless liberty live in dread of an agreement which has always been fraught with good and advantageous alike to sacred and civil interests blessed pope pius ix writes in quanta cura from which totally false idea of social government they do not fear to foster that erroneous opinion most fatal in its effects on the catholic church and the salvation of souls called by our predecessor gregory xvi an insanity viz that liberty of conscience and worship is each mans personal right which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever either by word of mouth by the press or in any other way even plainer points these are the errors condemned by blessed pope pius ix in syllabus of errors every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which guided by the light of reason he shall consider true in the present day it is no longer expedient that the catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the state to the exclusion of all other forms of worship hence it has been wisely decided by law in some catholic countries that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship of course all these contradict point at the top of this post second vatican council says in dignitatis humanae first the council professes its belief that god himself has made known to mankind the way in which men are to serve him and thus be saved in christ and come to blessedness we believe that this one true religion subsists in the catholic and apostolic church to which the lord jesus committed the duty of spreading it abroad among all men thus he spoke to the apostles go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have enjoined upon you matt on their part all men are bound to seek the truth especially in what concerns god and his church and to embrace the truth they come to know and to hold fast to it this vatican council likewise professes its belief that it is upon the human conscience that these obligations fall and exert their binding force the truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its own truth as it makes its entrance into the mind at once quietly and with power religious freedom in turn which men demand as necessary to fulfill their duty to worship god has to do with immunity from coercion in civil society therefore it leaves untouched traditional catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one church of christ over and above all this the council intends to develop the doctrine of recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human person and the constitutional order of society this vatican council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom this freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs whether privately or publicly whether alone or in association with others within due limits the council further declares that the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is known through the revealed word of god and by reason itself this right of the human person to religious freedom is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right it is in accordance with their dignity as personsthat is beings endowed with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear personal responsibilitythat all men should be at once impelled by nature and also bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth especially religious truth they are also bound to adhere to the truth once it is known and to order their whole lives in accord with the demands of truth however men cannot discharge these obligations in a manner in keeping with their own nature unless they enjoy immunity from external coercion as well as psychological freedom therefore the right to religious freedom has its foundation not in the subjective disposition of the person but in his very nature in consequence the right to this immunity continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation of seeking the truth and adhering to it and the exercise of this right is not to be impeded provided that just public order be observed at first this seemed contradictory to the previous popes but after reading tim staples i came to realize that it is not the case as these points from dignitatis humanae is not endorsing absolute freedom but as tim staples says by religious freedom the council meant men are to be immune from coercion this is absolutely consonant with catholic teaching and notice as well the council spoke of the evil of coercion by human power this in no way means man is not bound by gods law or by divine authority that was not even a consideration here in other words vatican ii is not presenting a right to error or a right to blaspheme it is presenting a negative righta right to not being coerced of course vatican iis dignitatis humanae in no way advocates for this condemned notion of absolute liberty so once again the attack leveled at vatican ii is without merit dh or vatican ii in general for that matter never says states have no right to establish themselves as truly christian nations or to grant a privileged status to gods true church on earth the rights dh are concerned with are rooted in a freedom from coercion that is in complete harmony with a catholic understanding of the moral law that has been taught all the way back to our lord and master himself as stated above source catholic answers religious liberty that to me was extremely reassuring as i tend to agree with the pontiffs quoted above however now i also read in dignitatis humanae the following provided the just demands of public order are observed religious communities rightfully claim freedom in order that they may govern themselves according to their own norms honor the supreme being in public worship assist their members in the practice of the religious life strengthen them by instruction and promote institutions in which they may join together for the purpose of ordering their own lives in accordance with their religious principles religious communities also have the right not to be hindered either by legal measures or by administrative action on the part of government in the selection training appointment and transferral of their own ministers in communicating with religious authorities and communities abroad in erecting buildings for religious purposes and in the acquisition and use of suitable funds or properties religious communities also have the right not to be hindered in their public teaching and witness to their faith whether by the spoken or by the written word however in spreading religious faith and in introducing religious practices everyone ought at all times to refrain from any manner of action which might seem to carry a hint of coercion or of a kind of persuasion that would be dishonorable or unworthy especially when dealing with poor or uneducated people such a manner of action would have to be considered an abuse of ones right and a violation of the right of others in addition it comes within the meaning of religious freedom that religious communities should not be prohibited from freely undertaking to show the special value of their doctrine in what concerns the organization of society and the inspiration of the whole of human activity finally the social nature of man and the very nature of religion afford the foundation of the right of men freely to hold meetings and to establish educational cultural charitable and social organizations under the impulse of their own religious sense besides the right of parents are violated if their children are forced to attend lessons or instructions which are not in agreement with their religious beliefs or if a single system of education from which all religious formation is excluded is imposed upon all it follows that a wrong is done when government imposes upon its people by force or fear or other means the profession or repudiation of any religion or when it hinders men from joining or leaving a religious community all the more is it a violation of the will of god and of the sacred rights of the person and the family of nations when force is brought to bear in any way in order to destroy or repress religion either in the whole of mankind or in a particular country or in a definite community this on the other hand states quite the opposite assuring that no religion can be suppressed and all has rights but isnt it directly contradicting what pope leo xiii and other pontiffs condemned harshly so my question comes down to this does every religion has a right can states ban religions other than catholicism,1,kqagtr

what constitutes a legitimate government my country brazil and usa were both formed by a rebellion against the legitimate government my country was formed because a son rebelled against his father the son of the king of portugal declared independence against the rule of his father our countries were formed by an act of transgression against the legitimate government the current brazilian republic is a product of a military coup against the brazilian royal family there was no popular support to the coup the population at the time was surprised that it happened about coup a man wrote this in a news paper at the time that the coup happened the people watched it bestialized astonished surprised without knowing what it meant many seriously believed they were seeing a military parade what im saying is that the concept of legitimate government is too weak an armed force could subjugate a government and form a new one or a city could declare independence and form a new government saint paul said this let every soul be subject to higher powers for there is no power but from god and those that are are ordained of god is this absolute what if the government is a failed institution that its not serving the people and more important god cant a rebellion falls in the just war clausule,1,kp1ahz

how to talk with fellow catholics about god in person recently ive noticed myself in conversations with family members who are catholic where they begin talking about how they believe jesus behaved when he was on earth or their favorite story from the bible in this situation for some reason i feel awkward i am a practicing catholic and think about god often but i feel that my relationship with god is very personal and therefore i have difficulty sharing in a nonintellectual format like a debate or online discussion i know that my relationship with god should remain personal and close but i also know it isnt healthy behavior to not share my thoughts of him in casual conversation i just wanted to make this post to ask for suggestions on how one maintains that balance of having a personal relationship with god while also being open to discussions with others about him,1,koh90p

these are the main reasons i left christianitycatholicism in no particular order if god is omniscient why would he create beings whom he knew in advance were destined for hell the religion one believes is heavily correlated with geography being born in india makes it far more likely that you will be hindu than christian for cultural reasons does this mean being born in certain areas makes it far more likely that you will make it into heaven than being born in other places sounds rather arbitrary why would a loving god send people to eternal torture simply for not believing in him sounds rather vain and selfabsorbed the catholic churchs opposition to birth control is one of the most irrational and indefensible positions of which i am aware i know not all christian denominations are antibirth control but when i learned of the catholic opposition i immediately stopped calling myself a catholic birth control prevents the spread of stds alleviates generational poverty prevents unwanted pregnancies and unloved children allows for women to be better educated prevents unlimited population growth and even prevents abortions its just plain stupid for an organization that opposes abortions to also oppose the number one thing that would prevent abortions i knew a lot of nonreligious people who seemed to live perfectly happy and fulfilling lives peoples lives shouldnt be dictated by their gender or sex when my conservative eightysomething grandfather said that he thought the catholic church should get with the times and allow women priests bishops etc that was an eyeopener for me to just how regressive and just plain sexist some religious rules are a lot of religions seem to push traditional stereotypes that women dont like sex and must dress modestly to keep safe from sexcrazed men which i think is equally offensive to both sexes why the hell would the creator of the universemultiverse care so much about your sex life or the way you style your hair why would a deity care whats so bad about sex anyway how am i pure for being a virgin what about a penis removes innocence how is something immoral if it doesnt harm anyone why is homosexuality a sin its even been observed in nonhuman animals i personally used to be a homophobe but then i realized there was no nonreligious reason to condemn homosexuality whats so bad about love some religious sects such as jehovahs witnesses and the amish actively oppose education and learning beyond a certain threshold when youre discouraged from learning theres a big hint youre being lied to i used to be antiabortion then i realized that abortions prevent unwanted children from growing up unloved abused in poverty etc sometimes the mother is addicted to drugs sometimes the fetus has horrible abnormalities sometimes the mother is underaged have compassion pregnancy is no small matter furthermore while it may be questionable to abort an eightmonth fetus for the first few weeks at least a fetus definitely isnt sentient for a really wonderful article on the subject read carl sagan and ann druyans essay is it possible to be both prolife and prochoice i used to be antiassisted suicide but then i realized that there is a difference between living and existed if i ever forgot my name or permanently lost control of my bowels or was in pain beyond comprehension i wouldnt want to live anymore if i ever get diagnosed with a terminal illness i would much prefer to be able to die on my own terms maybe with a few loved ones gazing out upon a scenic view rather than withering away awaiting the inevitable while struggling to breathe in a hospital bed somewhere some people say its giving up but i think that if anything its more dignified and honorable to face your fate with acceptance i consider myself someone who supports animal rights i intend on becoming a vegetarian and limiting my consumption of dairy and eggs immediately upon moving away from my parents science has shown that animals feel pain and suffer just like humans they too can feel love and joy most of the differences between humans and nonhuman animals are in degree only many religious traditions assert that only humans will get to experience an afterlife why are we alone gods chosen species the fact that so many religious people vote republican is appalling the republican party has a sickening history of destroying the environment for profit putting many peoples lives biodiversity and simple aesthetic beauty at risk for their own personal benefit they also tend to enact policies that benefit corporations and billionaires at the expense of the working class ironic for people whose religions often stress charity its weird that followers of the prince of peace are so adamant about their guns i dont need religion to live happily yes several dozen years of life is indubitably infinitesimally short in compassion to eternity living indefinitely though probably not literally forever would be nice but im ok with dying also about billion people have died in the past fifty thousand years many of them better people than i i know im insignificant in the immensity of space and time but i dont care i can make my own meaning in the things that i do and the people i love whether or not there is a deity or an afterlife is beyond human comprehension there may very well be but i dont know and dont pretend to i can live with the ambiguity creationism is nonsense a disgrace to science i know not all religious people are creationists but to believe in your own fantasies in spite of the evidence to refuse to question your beliefs to purposefully align the evidence with the preheld conclusion is the epitome of antiscience there sorry for the length i dont expect you to respond to all

ive been thinking about predestination thoughts about people who were born evil there are few quotes of bible which for calvinists mean there is such thing but im not bringing them because this post is not about it and in my opinion the way they interpretate them is completely wrong creating many contradictions to bible but i need to clarify what predestination in practice means it means that some people are born good and they are born to be redeemed but there are some people who are born bad and they are born to be damned whether you do good or bad things is only proof which one you are every person is different so everyone has different chance to be redeemed but what about people who really have not from their choice tho it may be place where they were born values from home or treats including mental disorders lets take a radical example stubborn uptight person locked for different people and ideas when this person was child he was told that god is bad this person rejects god keeps the sins and cant even fight it because he believes that he is doing right also he doesnt let other people even give arguments that he is doing something wrong but is there such person it turns out that there are many one of which i met some time ago he was born in sect and lets say he is very active person there he saw a cross on my chain and tried to detach me from catholicism all the arguments he used were based on ignorance he didnt accept proofs i showed him that they made no sense he keeps doing bad things and is freewillingly rejecting god it is straight way to hell i started thinking if he was really born to be damned we need a miracle to see anything else wouldnt that mean that there are indeed people born to be damned would god allow for it its part of other peoples free will but its still completely unfair to not even give this person a chance id like to ask all to pray for people like that because if there is one thing which can change anything in this case is prayer,1,kpvgqx
